# DATRO Net-Installer(s)

All the source code for our collection of autonomous, self-building disk images.
We've even made the compiling of these disk images full automated. 
Just visit the subdirectory corresponding to your requirement and run the `compiler.bash` script.
Alternatively visit our [Latest Releases](https://github.com/unclehowell/datro/releases/ "DATRO Net-Installer Latest Release") for pre-compiled disk images.

### Directory Structure

Here's the directory structure:

        /hbnb/armf        # HotspotBnB for ARM (to run on raspberry pi's - here's where it all began for HBnB)
        /hbnb/x86_64      # HotspotBnB for x86 (to run on your laptop if you don't have a raspberry pi)
 
        /togo/x86_64      # To Go (persistent live) USB, for x86 architecture
