# DATRO Consortium: 'net-installer' Branch 

This source-code repo branch is entitled: 'net-installer' *(short for unattended, network-based, self-installing/building, disk images)*  
**[Three other branches](#Branches)** also exist within this monorepo.   

### Detailed Structure
The table below shows the content of this branch, including all the source code of our collection of autonomous, self-building MicroSD and (Persistent-Live) USB Disk Images. We've even made the compiling of the abovementioned disk images (source code > img.xz) a full automated process.   
Just visit the subdirectory corresponding to your requirements and run the `compiler.bash` script.  
Alternatively visit our [Latest Releases](https://github.com/unclehowell/datro/releases/ "DATRO Net-Installer Latest Release") for pre-compiled disk images.
