# DATRO Net-Installer(s)

All the source code for our collection of autonomous, self-building disk images.
We've even made the compiling of these disk images full automated. 
Just visit the subdirectory corresponding to your requirement and run the `compiler.bash` script.
Alternatively visit our [Latest Releases](https://github.com/unclehowell/datro/releases/ "DATRO Net-Installer Latest Release") for pre-compiled disk images.
