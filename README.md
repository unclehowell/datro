# DATRO Net-Installers

This monorepo branch ('net-installer') contains the source code for compiling our autonomous disk images.

View the README.md in the subdirectories for instructions on compiling fresh builds. 


### Directory Structure

net-installer

        /hbnb/armf        # HotspotBnB for ARM (to run on raspberry pi's - here's where it all began for HBnB)
        /hbnb/x86_64      # HotspotBnB for x86 (to run on your laptop if you don't have a raspberry pi)
 
        /togo/x86_64      # To Go (persistent live) USB, for x86 architecture

        /{more to follow}

* maybe worth combining both hbnb and togo usb, to produce hbnb on a USB (plug and play HotspotBnB, super cool)
