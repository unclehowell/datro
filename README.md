All the source code on this branch include our collection of autonomous, self-building MicroSD and (Persistent-Live) USB Disk Images.
We've even made the compiling of the abovementioned disk images (source code > img.xz) a full automated process. 
Just visit the subdirectory corresponding to your requirements and run the `compiler.bash` script.
Alternatively visit our [Latest Releases](https://github.com/unclehowell/datro/releases/ "DATRO Net-Installer Latest Release") for pre-compiled disk images.
