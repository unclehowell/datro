#custom-settings/config/files to raspberrypi-ua-netinst/config/files
#
# To add custom files on the target system:
# Add one line per file using this format: 
# <ownership> <permission> <path/filename>
#
# <ownership>     [OWNER][:[GROUP]] (see `man chown`)
# <permission>    MODE  (see `man chmod`)
# <path/file>     /path/as/it/will/appear/on/the/target/system.txt
# 
# Source files are stored in the directory `config/files` in the same path as
# where they will be stored on the target system.
#
# EXAMPLE:
# A file placed on the SD-card in /config/files/home/pi/.bashrc is listed as follows:
# pi:pi  755  /home/pi/.bashrc
