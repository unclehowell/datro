# To add custom files on the target system:
# Add one line per file using this format: 
# <ownership> <permission> <path/filename>
#
# <ownership>     OWNER[:GROUP] (see `man chown`)
# <permission>    MODE  (see `man chmod`)
# <path/file>     /path/as/it/will/appear/on/the/target/system.txt
# 
# Source files are stored in the directory `config/files` in the same path as
# where they will be stored on the target system.
#
# EXAMPLE:
# A file placed on the SD-card in /config/files/home/pi/.bashrc is listed as follows:
pi:pi  755  /home/pi/.bashrc
pi:pi  755  /etc/init.d/build.sh

# Don't forget to call the function:
# install_files my-files.list
# from your `post-install.txt` where "my-files.list" is this file. 
# The function `install_files` will assume the file is located in the `config` directory.
