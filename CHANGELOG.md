# Changelog

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-24

### Improved
- Add a consistent, high-contrast `:focus-visible` outline for links, buttons and form controls to make keyboard navigation easier to track.
- Respect the existing dark/brass design tokens; no case data or FOI statuses changed.

### Reviewed
- Read the static styles and public-record workflow documentation. Dynamic data correctness requires running the app and its existing tests in the deployment environment; this CSS-only change was not represented as a full runtime test.
