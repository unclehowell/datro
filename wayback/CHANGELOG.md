## [-wayback.01] - Q2/2021

### Added
Sep-13 - This branch, previously accessible via datro.world, is now succeeded by world.datro.xyz. Futhermore this branch wont have its own GUI's  
       - Instead the HotspotBnB GUI will perform the function of datro world (displaying the consortiums portfolio of assets, as oppose to apps)  
       - Archived media will still exist in the /wayback/ subdirectory, although the GUI to navigate its content will be replaced   
       - In summary, datro.xyz/static/library/ will now diplay a few archived items, but to go "wayback" you'll need to switch to "wayback mode"  
       - wayback mode is the same library GUI, but the url will change to world.datro.xyz/wayback/,  
       - similar to the HotspotBnB GUI the library GUI will subsequently serve different content.  
       - this is achived by placing a frame in world.datro.xyz/wayback/index.html , which displays datro.xyz/static/library   
       - accessing the same GUI, from a different URL through a frame, seems illogical, but it's how we keep everything on 1 domain name  
       - it's how we remain under the netlify billing threshold, it's how we remain within github pages 1 site, 1 CNAME, 1 URL policy
       - ssl and x-frame issues maybe encountered since the gh-pages server is not dynamic (websites are serverless), so no x-frame policy can be set (as far as we're away)   
       - due to all the content being on the same domain, we should overcome a lot of issues, but the subdomain CNAME's do point to url's generated by netlify,  
       - so between the website visitors, cloudflare, netlify and gh-pages, doing what we're doing here, it'll be a miracle/short lived if we pull this off  
       - this isn't just an interim solution to maintain uptime without funding dedicated servers etc. It's actually a goal of DATRO to operate online and offline at zero cost! 

23-May - Added `2021-05-08_consortium_finance-funding_creditors_v0.0.5.pdf`  
22-May - Added `2021-03-15_consortium_plans-test_network_v0.0.1.pdf`  
22-May - Added `2021-05-10_consortium_finances-funding_investors_v0.1.9.pdf`  
12-May - Added `2021-05-06_consortium_finances-funding_investors.v0.1.7.pdf` which should have been commited days ago, unsure why it wasn't   
08-May - Added `2021-05-02_consortium_campus-sitesurvey_jamhighland_v0.0.1.pdf`  
08-May - Added `2021-05-08_consortium_finance-funding_creditors_v0.0.4.pdf`  
08-May - Added `2019-12-09_wave-tokens-wit_v0.1.3.pdf` (visit [library.datro.world](https://library.datro.world "DATRO Library") and navigate to `consortium_financials/funding_creditors` to view latest release)   
02-May - Added `font-size: max(3vw);` to mobile media query to help resize all text to fit viewport/screen width   
02-May - Added archive copies of old business plans  
02-May - Added `white-space:nowrap;` to wayback to prevent titles breaking onto two lines on mobile devices   
02-May - Added archive copies of old Google Patent Purchase Agreements (origional e.g. v0.0.1 and revised copy v0.0.2) - latest release is in docs library e.g. v0.0.3  
18-Apr - Added a github API call, so that visiting datro.world/wayback/ (built and hosted with netlify) results in a visible indexed list of files  
13-Apr - 2021-04-13-datro-consortium-campus-0.0.0.pdf  
07-Apr - 2020-06-12_datro_consortium-investors_detailed_v0.1.6.pdf  

### Removed
02-May - Remove `DATRO` from title: `DATRO Wayback Explorer` Since its too much.  


### Changed
23-May - CSS changed to hide scroll bars on index.html/ file explorer  
08-May - Changed the treeview.json to display document title without `.pdf` at the end of each title (added PDF into page title instead e.g. wayback (pdf's)  

### Fixed
02-May - Since datro.world displays pages in a frame (including wayback) the PDF viewer/extension can fail, so the PDF's now open in a new tab  
02-May - Tryng `treeview.json` instead of `.treeview.json` since netlify shows 404 with `.files` whereas gh-pages doesn't - hence the error  
02-May - Explorer not fixed. Works offline, not online. Tried adding `./` at beginning of `.treeview`  
02-May - Jquery was missing from _theme-explorer - added it - explorer fixed ?  
02-May - Repaired wayback (html view) explorer/navigator, using .treeview.json and index.html - sourced from gh-pages branch (/static/library)
