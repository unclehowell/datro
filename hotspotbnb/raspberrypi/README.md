# HotspotBnB Rpi-OS

This monorepo branch (rpi-os) contains the source code for the latest hotspotbnb image for the raspberry pi (all models).

## Users

Get started ... https://github.com/unclehowell/HBnB/releases

## Developers

### Platform (websites)

1. Ensure your local machine is prepped, or try our Persistent Live USB
2. Fire up your machine and get the latest platform source code: https://github.com/unclehowell/HBnB/releases

### Client (MicroSD)

1. Get the latest RPI-OS release from https://github.com/unclehowell/HBnB/releases
2. Follow the instructions to copy the software onto the Micro SD Card.
3. The OS is netinstallable, so it's only 60Mb and will self-build. 

### Server (USB)

There is no central public server (other than gh-pages which hosts the static websites).
Instead HotspotBnB has its own development environment, in the form of a Peer-to-Peer, Local Machine, Persistent Live USB.
The Ubuntu Live USB image is netinstallable, similar to the Client-side OS.
