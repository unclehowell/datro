## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1-rtw.8] - 2020-09-09
### Added
    - The source of this video player solutions is https://freshman.tech/custom-html5-video/
    - 

### Changed
    - added two div's (left and right side of video), so that mousing over the video reveals the player
    - the reason there's a gap in the middle, is so that the play/pause still works when you click on the video
    - had there not been a gap, you'd not be able to start/stop the video by clicking it. which is how most people do it I guess.
