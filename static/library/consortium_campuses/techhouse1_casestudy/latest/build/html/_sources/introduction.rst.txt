Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This document details the DATRO Consortiums creditors.
Unlike most organizations, DATRO simultaneously operates its own bespoke and internal cryptocurrency banking system and services.
This new trend in tech, business, and finance is most commonly referred to as Decentralised Finance (DeFi) and a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO).
This report focuses on the creditor account data only.

The concept of loans, interest, and other such financial instruments surrounding promissory notes isn't new.
But our DAO method is s preferred way of automating the administration, transactions, and record-keeping of this business area.
DATRO's DAO is also being developed to autonomously maintain these financial reports, updating them each time a block of transactions occur, in order, it remains as consistent as possible to the institutional method of changelogs, reports, and document archiving for a smoother transition from company to DAO.
At the time of writing these reports are compiled from source by a system administrator and custom build script, in order to check processes and procedures before going fully autonomous.
In the event of a new release, our DAO will autonomously archive the source files of the previous version alongside the 'latest' directory e.g. 0-0-1, 0-0-2, etc. And autonomously archive the previously compiled PDF in our wayback archive, then reference the compiled PDF in the release notes of the new publication (under the section 'previous versions').

As a final note, we take this opportunity to state that our DAO is also sometimes referred to as a DAS (Decentralised, Autonomous Society) due to the magnitude of the stakeholders involved, which constitute the organization being a stand-alone (cyberspace-based/digital) society/system of governance and not your typical organization.
For more information on DeFi and DAO's, please conduct your own research online as the subject is extensive.
