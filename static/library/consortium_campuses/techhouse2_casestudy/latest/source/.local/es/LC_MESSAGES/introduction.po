"Relevant fiscal data is retrieved from DATRO's federated accounting "
"solution. Bookkeeping/accounts is no exception where it concerns "
"federated localhost Progressive WebApp(PWA)'s. DATRO's Decentralized "
"Autonomous Societies (DAS)'s smart contracts, then scrape the latest "
"report to determine what suppliers (and what amounts and when) to "
"autonomously pay. At this time fiscal data isn't retrieved fully "
"autonomously during the document re-compile/update (rebuild.sh) process. "
"The custom script (custom.sh) and data import methodology still needs "
"more improvement before this can happen. This report is subsequently "
"compiled manually, which is currently intensive since the report is new "
"and exports must be manually adjusted to fit the documents desired "
"format, especially where it concerns data and tables."

"We change the titles of the columbs e.g. `currency` becomes `unit` and "
"`transaction amount` = `volume` - This allows more columbs to squeez into"

"Seperate the final balance into a seperate table. This way the number of "
