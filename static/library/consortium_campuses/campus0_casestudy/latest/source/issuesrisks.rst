Campus Concerns

Team Concerns
#################

- Junior "Pingu" (Haitian Groundkeeper/ Security) brought his wife and child from town to live in his groundskeepers property with him. 
- This was not authorised and noisy and prohibited, since it was a place of work and the security level was Yellow/ Orange (Elevated/ High). 

 but no provisions were made to assist the situation. Our events organiser/ local relations identified this matter and remedied it. 


Other Concerns 
###############

- Hire car is based on a tourist rate/ on a short-term fee (Sion's same supplier and car from previous trips to the DR)
- The cost inccured for April - October 2014 was in the region of $12,000 USD

Deal Issues
##############

The final weeks went as follows (to the best of our recollection):

 * All dogs poisoned in the neighbourhood. Dog that came with the property (Jaws) was poisoned to death and found in a nearby ditch (a common act of thieves prior to thefts).
 * Electricity went off to the whole street for weeks. And battery and generator experienced issues. Lessee had to all go stay in a hotel in Santo Domingo.
 * It was reported that Electricity didn't come back onto the area for the remainder of the lease and worse still, quarrying began next door to the property and was very noisy e.g. trucks struggling up the hills, hammer action digging into rockfaces etc.
 * The 6 month lease was expiring and purchase agreement date was approaching, while the Lessee was in a hotel in Santo Domingo, because of the inhability of the property.
 * A new 6 month lease was signed, but under 'Vi Coactus (V.C/ duress) and in lieu of electric to the town coming back on, quarrying schedule explaining & full legal discovery (title deeds, lien clearance, easements etc)).
 * The Lessor made no discounts or satisfy the above concerns with supported evidence. Instead there was an insistance and even aggression for the Lessee to proceed with the deal, regardlesss of the properties inhabitable nature and the Lessees unfulfilled queries and concerned.
 * The Lessee made no payment towards the renewed leasehold agreement as a consequence of the above. The final payment of the lease may have also been neglected as a consequence of the above. Which would have resulted in the Lessor using some of the security deposit (what it's there for), especially in light of the fact no damage was caused to the property.
 * When stated no damage was caused to the property, there was one alteration which was viewed as a damage by the Lessor. The Lessee installed steps from the vehicle driveway to the front door as the grass hill was very steep and hazardous (slippery) when wet. Steps had to be installed into the grass verge, but the contractors workmanship was very poor.
 * It all ended very confusingly because of the language barrier and the fact the Lessee was having to stay away in a hotel for week, in addition to other concerns and complexities (quarrying, purchase agreement signing with missing documents etc)


**Conclusion:** Both parties went their seperate ways rather amicably, both equally dispositioned by the final month of dealings. It is the conclusion of the Lessee, had the quarrying not begun or the electric gone off to the area, there would have been no questions asked and no undisclosed hotel/safe distance from which to negotiate from.
Without the unfortunate events that placed the Lessee on the defensive during the final weeks of the leasehold, the Lessee may have continued forward, purchasing a property with a greater risk of undisclosed liens, easements and years of noisy quarrying and electricity cuts for weeks on end.

**2014-10-05** - Updated

 - Moved directly from Hotel in Santo Domingo (via Casa Llandovery to grab our stuff)
 - Ended up Reorganising ("ReOrg"ing) at Los Gringos, Playa de Magante, Gaspar Hernández on the north side
 - Gaspar Hernández is 40 minutes drive east of Cabrera (the North West/ beginning of the 'Scottish Bay' Coastline).
 - Our arrival to Playa de Magante is the beginnings of **Campus Two** (see the seperate 'Campus Two' Case Study/ Document for details).



Campus Issues

Team Issues
############

1. Uninvited guests/ trasspassers entered the main gates of the property, at night, causing a security drill to be triggered 
e.g. bugging out and heading up to the 3rd level and beyond until the all clear was given over radio and the team could return to the property.

The bug-out ended up being a false alert. A negligent member of staff (the same one who crashed the vehicle) 
thoughtlessly invited an unauthorised person onto the property and was in the vehicle which followed far behind his associate. 
The unauthorised visitor took it upon themselves to enter the main gates not aware of the silent alarm and protocols they triggered.


Other Issues
##############

This issue is a leading example of how quickly a situation can escelate. 
In this case due to a faulty vehicle, a dangerous driveway, poor communications, an inexperienced driver and poor timing by the injured party.
