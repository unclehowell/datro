Plan
============


Deal Plan
~~~~~~~~~~~

- 6 months lease in lieu of a purchase agreement:
   - **Leasehold Terms:** `6 month leasehold at $2.5k per month + 2 months security deposit` 
   - **Purchase Terms:** `5 'amortization' installments of $50k every 6 months`

Lease In Lieu of Purchase
################################

- `All lease payments (& security deposit) serve as a deductable amortization credit during the purchase agreement`
- `Duration of lease (in this case 6 months) serves as a trial run for both the buyer and seller prior to an amortization`


Assurances
#################

The deal plan was assured using the concept of a "Soft Probe" (whereby the Lessor/Seller is granted access to the Lessee's/Buyer's accounts, to determine fiscal credibility).
DATRO's working capital for that year, was proven to be in the region of $200k+ USD -/+ 10%.

The legitemacy of the source of this capital was also proven e.g. investments and loans (albeit no trading activity/ sales revenues etc)
One source of a 74,000 GBP investment was for example, from the sale of a UK asset (45 Gregory Ave, Breaston, England, DE72 3DJ), which sold for Â£135,750 GBP in 2014.
The above info provided the Lessor/ Seller with sufficient assurances to proceed with this deal plan, terms and the aforementioned payment schedules.
DATRO's investor/ creditor public reporting can be found in the `DATRO Consortium Document Library <https://datro.xyz/static/library/>`__


Business/Technolgy Plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A copy of business plan, drafted in July 2014, can be located in our archives at `this address <https://datro.world.xyz/wayback/2014-07-24_consortium_plans-operations_business_v0.0.2.pdf>`__.

Name Plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DATRO Consortium will name the property **Casa Llandovery**.
The name Sion gave his former private residence, where his son Milo was born (back in Stockeld Park, Yorkshire (North England)) the previous year.
Llandovery originates from the name of the Welsh town and private boarding school where Sion studied before attending college/ the military and becoming an engineer.

Team Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The team generally worked together well to create a campus that ran like clockwork.
The main development and productivity happened in the loft, with Armani and Sion.
Outside of developing there was BBQ's in the evening, walks to the waterfall in the day.  
The team also went out in the local town for food and ordered takeaways from time to time. 
Movie nights and friends visiting, was also helpful to our wellbeing. 
Sadly there was a lot of security concerns and attacks at the time.
