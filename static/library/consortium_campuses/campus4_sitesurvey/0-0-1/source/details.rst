1. The Seller is the owner of this plot of land - Following purchase of the site, almost 2 years ago. 

2. There are no liens on the Certificate of Title(s) - A certificate confirming this can be obtained upon request - The Seller is subsequently able, willing and in a position to sell.  

3. The name on the Certificate of Title(s) has been kept in the previous owners name: Mr. Karl Franz Stark:  

    -  The name on the Certificate of Title(s) was left unchanged at Mr. Cronin's request
    -  Mr. Cronin and his legal council (`Guzman lawfirm <https://drlawyer.com/>`__ ) are still able, willing and in a position to transfer the Certificates of Title(s) from Mr. Stark to a new buyer, in the event of a sale. 
    -  The previous owner is reachable if there is a requirment for his participation.  

4. Each Certificate of Title has a corresponding plot drawing/map which constitutes an :ref:`Easement` e.g. road access, common land etc  
  
    - **2021-04-15** - The aforementioned easements are not stipulated in the text on the Certificate of Title, however Mr. Cronin remains confident his approach constitutes an easement in the eyes of the relevant authorities after consulting with them on this day

5. Connecting road (adjacent to plot), while undeveloped e.g. a gravel track, is actually a thoroughfare road:  

    -  South/West exit from plots entrance leads to: Carretera Las Terrenas - Sanchez, Las Terrenas
    -  North/East exit from plots entrance leads to: UNKNOWN AT THIS STAGE (presumably Las Terrenas town ?) 
    -  Plans do exist to tarmac/asphalt the thoroughfare road. Neighbouring roads were worked recently. This road is rumoured to be next in line at the mayors office 

6. In the even of a sale whereby the buyer(s) commit a payment - It will typically be held in Mr. Cronins' lawyers New York Bank account in escrow, until such time as the purchase completes in full e.g. the buyer(s) name(s) replaces Mr. Stark on the Certificate of Title(s).
