*************************

**Introduction**

This document is case study of the DATRO Consortiums "Tech House/Campus One": DATRO's first dedicated, off-grid, technology campus, beginning in June 2014.
This property is situated in the "Dominican Alps" - A group of ski lodge style villas, 6km beyond 'Jarabacoa' town in the Dominican Republic.
A place visited annually since the year 2011, by Sion H. Buckler, the DATRO consortiums Founder & CEO. 

This document reports the deal terms, activities and any other lessons learnt from Tech House One, which can be purposeful in future campus/tech house deals, plans, surveys etc
The first segment of this report is the releasenotes, which features key issues, changes and links to older versions of the document itself.   
The remainder of the layout of the document closely resembles a Prince 2 (project management methodology) highlight report, which orbits around 3 core segments: (1) Plans vs performance, (2) Issues, risks and concerns and (3) Plans moving forward.
