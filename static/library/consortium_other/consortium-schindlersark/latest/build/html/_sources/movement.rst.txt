The Movement
================================================

The Dominican Republic (DR) is a western-influenced Caribbean island, which is surrounded by British Oversease Territories, which are members of the commonwealth realm, with the British monarch; Queen Elizabeth II at its honouree head. The DR has developed a reasonable infrastructure and hundreds of high footfall holiday resorts, many five star. Yet less than 15% of homes on the island have internet access, making this an ideal, high-yield location for the alpha release trials of Wave.

Almost 70% of the DR's police and military, protect commercial interests of elites (over the needs of their own people), even more so than in Britain, while no cyber defence force exists. This non-UN terrain also serves as an ideal training ground and base of operation for the UTE to foment its revolutionary SFaaS system. While the Wave team focus on free internet access as UTE's 'front line' engineers (gaining new ground), a second team of engineers will work to roll out SFaaS onto this network and gain the consent of its users, to be governed by the UTE.
