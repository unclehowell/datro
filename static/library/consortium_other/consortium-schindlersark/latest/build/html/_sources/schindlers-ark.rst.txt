Schindlers Ark

SFaaS would be of immense value for unstable regions: and who better to implement this innovative solution, than the UTE's community of founding, military, police and PMC extropians. However, in stable regions and developed countries, there would need to be a cataclysmic event (or as explained earlier maybe just a medium scale event) before such a solution would gain adoption. There is however, a cataclysmic event rumoured to occur in Britain sometime during the lifespan of this operation. If Wave were providing free internet in Britain and the UTE have SFaaS ready to deploy to this network, it could come into power: re-introducing stability by acting as a viable socio-economic value exchange/ resource-management and self-governance solution.

This is the unexplained and largely unexplored fulfilment of the charter's promise, to liberate and empower people. Overcoming the disparity of a framework of legal fictions and instruments, which has superseded real people and technologies; architectural flaws of a post-industrial society and economic framework, which is no match for the knowledge-based ages colonising and preferred alternative solutions.

Cyprus is a great example and a clue about how Governments, (including the UK), might behave when they are in receivership e.g. bankruptcy. Secret plans are already rumoured to be in motion, to freeze UK citizens banking privileges, restrict daily withdraw to as little as 100 GBP per person and convert peoples savings into government bonds with no warnings or notice. This is will be a clear attempt by the elite's bankers and politicians to shift the UK's debts onto the 99.7%, their children and their childrenâ€™s children. This is a reoccurring tend throughout history which keeps the disparity going, generation to generation. The UTE can actually benefit from this inevitable destabilisation thanks to technologies such as PVCSE, SFaaS and Wave.
