Democracy in Technocracy
================================================

Within Wave, the logic gates and algorithms that determine what each free internet user can and cannot do are determined via the convention of a support tickets and feedback system. The alpha release of Wave and launch of the PVCSE in Q4 2014, will now be closely followed by a new voting feature, which will democratise the direction of the development of the platform by giving its anonymous beneficiaries real-time enjoyment of their voting rights. With SFaaS these 'logic-gate laws' will come into effect in much the same way, and are already interlinked with each user profile giving the UTE, SFaaS and Wave a similar multi level decision making platform as UK Parliament. The only differences being, Instead of a house of commons, free internet users can vote on Wave and extropians can vote on the UTE's SFaaS. Instead of lords, the founding extropians and their successors will vote on the direction of the UTE as well as SFaaS and Wave.
