<h1>Social Framework as a Service (SFaaS)<a class="headerlink" href="#social-framework-as-a-service-sfaas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A secondary application of this technology is its open-sourced militarisation into, what is being referred to as the worlds first ‘Social Framework as a Service’ (SFaaS). To elaborate on what this is, first consider Private Military Contractors (PMC’s) which is an explosive industry in which the UTE now associates itself. PMC’s accounted for a seventh of the forces on the ground in Iraq in 2003. By 2007 these soldiers-for-hire outnumbered the ones Governments sent. In 2014 this relatively unregulated industry grew to $218 billion and continues to grow at an exponential rate. This new proposal from the UTE is the cyber equivalent of a PMC, except the technology will not empower corporations in exchange for relinquishment of their capital. Instead, the Wave technology will liberate free internet users in unstable regions with SFaaS, with the inevitable expectancy of them relinquishing their ‘consent to be governed’ to the UTE.</p>
<p>At the heart of the internet and cyberspace is the main nomenclatures of cloud computing: platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and the list goes on (DaaS, BaaS and ITMaaS). Cities are also becoming smarter and more interconnected with the ‘internet of things’ (IoT) which includes wearable devices. Online self-teaching platforms are already so popular; they are now being favoured over state-run educational institutions. We are seeing the same trends with virtual currency over regular currency and crowd-sourced people-people apps, over car rental and hotel companies etc. It is just a matter of time before something as simple as a social, dispute resolution platform emerges and becomes more popular than the state services of a court. We can even expect to see a social debt cancellation circle, which uses the shrinking ‘degrees of separation’ to add liquidity back into the economy. SFaaS brings all of these together in one user interface, making it the inevitable next nomenclature in cloud computing.</p>
<p>The features necessary for SFaaS are already in place with Wave, subject to some re-configurations. For example, land, vehicle, business and even property registration with the state will evolve, replacing deeds with a kind of social network page, which could also access our PVCSE, giving owners the ability to trade/share ownership and distribute royalties accordingly. These newly renounced items from the state will fall onto common ground under the monarch, before they are consensually surrender into the logic of this technocracy by the equitable owners. This new society will organically form from this migration of technologies, resources and eventually people. One of the greatest benefits of life under the UTE in Britain will be the restoration of balance between capitalism/statutes, and socialism and the commons - using innovative new technologies.</p>
<p>Each registration of land, resources (including the electoral of human resources e.g. people) and technology, will hold commercial value via the PVCSE. However, a new logarithmic social endorsement system (the equivalent of an open credit scoring system) will introduce a new, social bearing on its perceived value to society, as oppose to just its economic value. For example, in one trade union letter during the industrial revolution, it stated that 170 machines extended 17 miles across Leeds and outputted an unprecedented amount of produce and subsequent profit for the company and its shareholders. However, there was an appeal to the humanity and mercy of these giants, as each machine replaced ten workers, driving an entire community of homes, businesses and schools from their roots, to make way for the nation’s economic need for a largely derelict, sterile industrial estate.</p>
