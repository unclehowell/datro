Getting Started Guide
======================

**Setting Up LaS:** - LaS comes in two parts. An Operating System for the Raspberry Pi (RPi) and an Operating System for the Main Computer. Copy the RPi OS to its Micro SD Card and insert it. And copy the Machine OS to a USB Dongle and boot up the machine. Next connect the RPi to the computer using an Ethernet Cable and boot it up. For troubleshooting (if you run into problems) it can also be handy to have a display and mouse/keyboard for the RPi. 

It takes around a minute for the RPi and machine to boot up, although the first time can take longer. Upon successful boot you will be able to connect to the Wi-Fi from the main machine as you would any normal PC. On the desktop you will see an icon, which runs a script to establish a connection with the RPi to open up Android on the Main machine using the mightly ScrCpy. This is faster than hosting Android in a virtual machine and/or trying to setup remote access.  

**Our Hardware Solutions ...** The RPi used in LaS Version 1.0 is the Raspberry Pi 3B+, although the OS should run on any RPi. The machine we're using in Version 1.0 is an IBM (Touchscreen) SurePoint 500 POS, which has an Intel Celeron Processor and since it has no onboard Wi-Fi (and the Ethernet is being occupied by the RPi) we've added a Wireless Dongle (something something 88EU Chipset).
