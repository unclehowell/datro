Software
=========

Upgrades and updates for the base operating systems (LyneageOS e.g. Android, on the Raspberry Pi and Linux Ubuntu on the PC) are set to happen automatically after the prompt to update/ upgrade is accepted.

The LaS aspects which contains custom source code for the touchscreen and connection between the two machines, is able to be remotely maintained. The source code is hosted in a public repository (GitHub) and the two machines are configured to check for updates to this source code twice daily. In the case of full LaS upgrades, the new version of the Operating System images will need to be downloaded and then loaded onto the machines e.g. copying to the SD Card/ USB Dongle and inserted into the Raspberry Pi and PC then rebooted.   


Hardware
=========

For physical maintenance it's important to air dust the PC and RPi from time to time since they gather dust. 
Instructions for opening up the PC and the RPi can be found on the Hardware Maintenance section of the hardware manufacturers websites.
