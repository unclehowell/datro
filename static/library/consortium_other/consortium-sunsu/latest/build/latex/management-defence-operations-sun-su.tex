\chapter{Overview}
\label{\detokenize{overview:overview}}\label{\detokenize{overview::doc}}
This memorandum forms the foundation for a new stock and business structure for Wave Telecom. The purpose of the document is to define these new arrangements in enough detail, so existing and future stakeholders in Wave can understand the purpose of the proposed changes. Once approved in principle these new arrangements wiil be executed with immediate effect. Change requests wiil be processed for minor alterations following the documents initial release.

Authorising this memorandum confirms that a majority of the owners of Wave. understand and support what is being proposed by the founder and new Series A investor. This document aiso details ali current known issues, risk, concerns in preparation for the execution of this 2015 investment memorandum entitled Operation ‘Sun Su’.


\section{Background}
\label{\detokenize{overview:background}}

\subsection{\sphinxstylestrong{Wave Telecom}}
\label{\detokenize{overview:wave-telecom}}
Wave Telecom formed as a private trust in 2012 and has since been financed by a community of active and ex-duty, British Forces telecommunications and cyber security engineers. In accordance with its 2014-17 business plan this technology venture works to develop and release a free internet access solution. This charter was also presented to the United Nations Telecoms Union in Dubai in November 2012 in the form of a document entitied ‘Operation Tech Saxon’. Business activity since this conference has primarily comprised of investment, research, technological and business development and some initial design concepts e.g. a basic website with a secure and functional user portal.

The methods and approach taken by Wave are also completely pioneering. Funds generated from advertising to users of Wave are forwarded to their internet service providers (ISP’s) to compensate data consumption costs, resulting in a completely free internet access service. Trends show that global display advertising spend will reach \$200billion in 2015 while data consumption costs continue to descend. Forecasts indicate a 2015 crescendo where revenue generation per user would be enough to meet their data consumption costs. As these trends continue the margins are expected to increase, effectively making this market and business opportunity more and more lucrative as time goes on. In accordance with a technology principle called Metcaltes law, this free internet solution would also be capable of scaling to every internet access point on the globe whilst remaining completely free to the end user. Since 2012 Wave has worked to position itself to capitalise on this incredible opportunity.

It’s widely accepted that only highly developed advertising piatforms with excellent targeting, could generate the level of funds needed for this approach to be feasibly. Google AdWords for exampie, was bought for \$200Billion in around 1998 and now accounts for 93\% of the corporations \$83Billion+ annual turnover. Unlike online adverising delivery platforms. Wave will serve a new standard in display advertising via the Wi-Fi access point themselves. With Wave these ads appear over the websites using unique techniques and technologies pioneered by Wave and DD-WRT. Until the advertising moduie of this platform is developed to a level comparable with oniine advertising platforms Wave will need to make up the data consumption costs using another innovative monetisation technique. This alternative means of revenue was successfully devised by Wave and its as simple as utilising abundant processing power on devices connected to the newly upgraded Wi-Fi router. This process, known as virtual currency mining, is discreet to the end-user and trials show is was plausible on individual devices. Wave expects to become somewhat of a large network from 2015 and on larger networks (as a supplement revenue channel only\} this solution does appear to meet the objective. The approach, concept and technology is completely groundbreaking and is expected to complete the ever shrinking gap between early advenising revenue and data consumption costs. This is key when attempting to be the first to market with this type of highly scalable, completely free internet access service.

While exploring virtual currency Wave also devised a method of determining net profits in real time, then dividing these funds between sharehoiders on an hourly basis as oppose to the traditional method of quarterly dividends, bookeeping and manually instructing the banks. The team at Wave then developed a private virtual currency securities exchange which helps automate the trading of equity between these shareholders. The innovations are endless because the challenges being faced are primarily technological in nature. For example, Wave is continuously having to overcome security countermeasures employed by advertising-dependant websites. which are specifically designed to obstruct the kind of advertising-revenue interception that Wave depends on. There are also some political and financial challenges.

This type of technology undoubtedly poses a threat to the monopoly which exists in digital adverting. In addition to exercising technological countermeasures, these same firms have lobbied for sanction-type legisiation to systematically outlaw Wave’s monetisation techniques in the name of data protection. Meanwhile virtual currency Iaws have become more complex and alter depending on the jurisdiction, which also threatens Wave. ISP’s are ordered to block url’s and unlawful FBI raids arrests and seizures are being forced onto disruptive web services and their founders. The sustainability of a technology of this kind is a secondary risk to known threats which have already sought to upend the very creation of Wave in the first instance. During 2014 a succession of targeted DDoS attacks occurred on Waue’s servers, the interactive website demo had to be disabled due to spam attacks and a malicious website simuitaneousiy appeared online, dedicating itself to sabotaging Wave and the credibiiity of its founder. These attacks were mister-meaner and domestic in nature, but they did serve as a pre-cursor for what could be ahead of Wave if more powerful agencies felt inclined to try and stamp out Wave. For this reason specific security countermeasures were put in place.

Until Wave is fully developed and deployed into cyberspace risks will be managed by decentraiised the platform using new development methodologies and eventually PirateBay-pioneered anti-raid pseudo-DNS technology - TOR and VPN configured access points are also being used, which disguise the developers identity and location and Cloudflare supported secure hosting, as well as this re-branding and divestment memorandum have also been put in place. The naysayers slander and attacks on Wave in 2014 were based on a toxic perception that this tech start-up is merely a website or an application which would normaly take a matter of weeks or months to develop and for a fraction of the cost. This is most certainly not the case.

As is made clear in this memorandum, Wave is developing a platform which brings people free internet access by giving ISP’s a transposed billing solution. This is achieved by giving developers and adyettisers a new platform to run a new standard of applications and advertising-campaigns upon. It’s also scalable, anonymous-user based and has created a universal server-side and firmware based technology which is capable of deploying onto a global network of DSL Wi-Fi internet access points, used by hundreds of millions of people across the globe. This is all expected to occur within a matter of weeks from the scheduied launch date of July 2015. Many of the technologies needed to achieve Wave’s charter didn’t actually exist when the architecture of the piatform was initially designed, they came into existence some 3 years afterwards, many of which have been engineered by the Wave team. The purpose of beginning the development of the platform years in advance of the market opportunity even existing, was to position this technology ready to exploit the opportunity as soon as it becomes available, without the added pressure of time and funding constraints.

Google’s CEO Eric Schmidt once said that trillion dollar tech companies’ biggest threat is still ‘some kid working from his bedroom’. For governments operating in cyberspace, this is also true. Cases now exist of technically gifted individuals who are now so established in cyberspace’s alternative socio-political economy that they view their status in the existing social, economic and governance systems as a constraint. In cyberspace anonymity protects democracy and human rights. For this very reason one individual has gone as far as renouncing his citizenship to become entirely dependant on cyberspace and his anonymous status. This is a case of eariy adoption. but for what? After further research into cyberspaces alternative socio-political economy, Wave has concluded that once again it must advance onto the absolute cutting-edge of cyberspace. For this reason a completely new concept has been devised.


\subsection{\sphinxstylestrong{United Kingdom}}
\label{\detokenize{overview:united-kingdom}}
In Britain the United Kingdom {[}UK{]} society was formed in 1801 through the Act of Union agreement. This society has its own coat of arms which is a slight deviation from that used by the Britain the Country and the British Royal family. The Queen and her subjects (British Citizens) would give their consent through membership registration (becoming UK citizens), for this administrative body (we call ‘UK Society’), to manage us, our land, resources and children etc. This consent and freedom to leave, join or form any society we wanted, is what made Britain a democracy - an understanding which those under oath to the Country, swore to uphold. And in the case of the military community behind Wave, personally have risked our lives fighting to defend this fundamental inherent right and freedom. Whilst performing functions of this society, in order to serve the British people, one would be held to a higher standard via the societies own rules, know as Statutes or Acts. Membership to the UK society involves Citizens of Britain each taking turns to perform functions of this society. The society also expects members/citizens to pretend their sovereign status and divine and inherent rights and freedoms (as free subject of a monarch) are disregarded or beneath the juristiction of this societies rules, and instead live within a virtual reality of afforded (and revocable) benefits and privileges of membership.

Benefits to memebers and those performing functions for this society were once so great, that a system was devised to extend membership to new born children in order they begin receiving these benefits from post-birth registration. When free British subjects of the monarch register ourselves and our children, inherently giving consent to be governed by UK rules, the society uses the registered name {[}known as ‘equitable title’\} to form a UK society-owned intellectual property known as a ‘LEGAL TITLE (all caps)’. Brits are then permitted to identify themseives with this UK legal name to gain the benefits of membership, providing we follow this societies rules, now 750+ rule books in total (statues and acts). Like any membership this could be cancelled at any time (UK Home Office FormRN), which naturally upholds the society to continually provide members actual benefits of membership, or else find itself without any. Renouncing citizenship from the UK society (and returning to life a free British subject of a monarch e.g. a British citizen) was a mere 144 GBP and only a single form away ……. until 2014.

In the last few months alone, the UK societies coat of arms (used on certificates of incorporation of the entities it creates) have been used in place of the monarchs oh sovereign documents. Simultaneously this society has taken it’s permission to use the monarchs coat of anns and claimed it as its own: further blurring the line between country/monarch and society/state e.g. the real and mans fictional construct, designed to reflect the real. From 2014 the process of renouncing became corrupted - to hand in citizenship/membership to the UK Society (and revert to being what we were at birth e.g. a British citizens) is no longer a small fee and straightforward form. The form now very deceptively railroads anyone renouncing into simultaniously surrendering their devine soverign status as British citizen/ subjects. This steithful colonisation of Britain, by this bloated society, can be seen everywhere. UK legalise has long twisted Queens English in order to deceive, exploit and subjugate the British people. Common law and constitution have also been repiaced with largely uniawful and unconstitutional statute rules/ acts. Even common British land and resources have been systematicaily transferred away from the British public, effectively becoming the property of the body which was employed to administer it. The title of Prime Minister for example actually means ‘main servant’, not the British peoples ruler. Life in modern UK Society is now like being enslaved in a misleading, criminal nationwide cult, attempting to systematically steal-from/harvest us of everything.

In late 2014 the Lisborn treaty was the final act of a succession of acts which have effectively replaced God with a world bank/ government (IMF/UN), replacing the British monarch/Queen with one of five new world districts (the EU). And replacing Britain the country, the real thing, with a fictional reflection of it we call UK Society.Even soldiers. police and judges have had their oaths to protect the Country. Queen and her subjects, corrupted (by replacing its British Coat of Arms with the 1801 UK Societies), transforming these Oaths into binding agreements to abandon a constitutional duty, to take up arms and serve a regime instead. Through a succession of tIojan-horse acts, the free people of this sovereign nation have just had their divine and inherent birth rights and freedoms replaced with prescribed (afforded and revocabie) benefits and privileges. Regardless of how this regime continues to behaves, the British people seemingly no longer have the freedom to deny their consent to be governed by it, due to the fact sovereign status is being aboiished by it. British people renouncing from this nationwide cult we call UK, using the newly corrupted forms, are unknowingly no longer protected by inherent rights since they’ve been railroaded into surrendering them. They may even be denied access to their own birth land or recognised as one of its people. Their fellow countrymen serving as police and soldiers can no longer even be depended on for protection, as they are now agents of this regime, not the Country and its people. By every definition this is a state of emergency. Britain is effectively no longer a democracy, since the freedom to leave, join or form any society we want is being abolished by a tyrant, corrupt, monopolising society.

The deceit and ransom tactics employed to gain the British peoples consent to be govemed by this regime, is evidence enough of the type of beast the UK regime has become. A divine right of free people is to exercise their free will, even if this means waivering benefits and refusing their consent for an entity to govern them and their children. However those who dare chose this option come under attack and even find their children forcibly removed and used to ransom them into contract or pay fees while their abducted children are held ransom, which is utter exploitation of children. The doctrine which keeps the the British people enslaved in this regime and away from the reality of what is reaily happening, is known as statism. What is happening in Britain and especially within the UK society itself, is now so disconnected from any definition of a civilised society, that it can only be likened to an evil, tyrannical and nationwide cult. This is in no way consistent with what it once meant to be British, or proud to serve ones Country.

Before this memorandum. Wave intended to continue its operation as a private {[}British common law{]} trust, operating as free British subjects of a monarch, away from the constraints of the fictional entities of the UK regime. But the 2014 demise of British constitution effectively invalidates this position and status. Many have seemingiy died in vein. Those inheriting duties to protect democracy are relied upon now to follow the spirit, if not the letter of their oaths, more than ever in history. The socio-poiitical landscape has altered drastically during 2014 and in 2015 extreme times are calling for extreme measures. The community behind Wave swore oath of allegiance to defend Queen and Country, not a nationwide, tyrannical cult-like society and its cult-like leaders. No longer being free to exist under God, Queen and Country, with rights and a constitution freedoms will cause feeling of ill-will and duress amongst patriots, but ultimately of being forced into a repressive, false-democracy as a ‘loyalists’, or forced from your birth land as the ultimatum, really is a jagged pill to swallow in the 21st Century. UK loyalist are attacking British democracy with these meticulous levels of deception and corruption in order to keep the imbalance of power in its favour. Powerlessness and disparity is sobering and in these times of turmoil, real leaders are looked upon. It’s unfortunate that this very concerning transition has managed to occur, but this British technoiogy venture and it’s community of financiers are not inclined to become more vocal or rebellious. To continue contesting this now wouid be counter productive and likely cause more unrest. A growing number of people are looking to servicemen and women to honour their oath and since Wave, it’s founder and community are in such a position of trust, it must be pragmatic and responsible moving forward. It is clearly time to cease all attempts to work through these problems and instead work around them. Wave may have just been forced ‘above ground’ but it will simultaneousiy be taking itself further underground. A UK company has been incorporated for one aspect of this technology platform: equally a movement has started which began with the publication of ‘Operation Schindlers Ark’ in late 2014. A 10 year plan is now firmly underway for a British technocracy entitled the United Technocracy of Extropy {[}UTE{]} to operate within the communications network. Both Wave and the UTE continue to grow in strength and numbers from anonymous locations, as anonymous individuals, using anonymous virtual currencies.

\subsection{\sphinxstylestrong{United Technocracy of Extropy (UTE)}}
\label{\detokenize{overview:united-technocracy-of-extropy-ute}}
One would expect a technology which makes internet access free to be met with a warm reception and to some degree it has.
In 2014 a Deloitte study reported that free internet access would increase global GDP by 25\%r creating over a hundred million new jobs and lifting an almost equal number of people out of poverty. However tech giants have proactively exercised countermeasure to protect their advertising income from the kinds of technologies being deveiopecl at Wave, which really is only the tip of an iceberge. Cyberspace is the Achilles heal of governments, banks and other powerful institutions because it is largely de-centraiised, anonymous, innovative and transparent making it impossible to control. Communist and even western ‘democratic’ regimes seem to be containing the above mentioned, by prolonging internet access as an affordable privilege and censoring information.  These really are the last two possible stands to keep the balance of power as it is, but it’s failing miserably in the face of innovation and clearly cannot be sustained. The last act of a dying kind so to speak.

Research carried out at Wave, indicate that this is the reason why free intemet access (as well as a free and open web) is equally being perceived as a threat. Not necessarily to individuai people, but to the social, economic and governmental systems which have existed for hundreds, if not thousands of years.
This was apparent during the 2012 global telecommunications conference in Dubai, in which Wave was in attendance. During this ‘open debate’, prolonging the affording of internet as a privilege and censoring and/or legisiating information seemed to be more of a priority to the United Nations (UN) than initiatives to free information and the people’s access to it. This clear uprising of a new technologicai socio-econornic order has not been properly reported on, it’s not been properly defined or labelled and trends online and off seem somewhat abstract. However all this being said, it seems to best fit the description of an emergence of a technocracy. Free internet as a human right would inevitably serve as a gateway to a technocracy, subsequently making Wave an essential part of this revolutionary movement.

Technocracy was first attempted in 1933 as an alternative form of govemance, but was rumoured to have been quashed by the US government before succeeding as a new order.
The spirit of the organisation, which gained more than 500,000 paying members within 18 months of its launch, continues on in Europe despite seeming inactive.
Much of Wave’s philosophical, ideological and political viewpoints are not only consistent with this alternative form of governance, but the work being carried out at Wave seems to be an opportunity for a British technocracy which could grow to operate throughout the commonwealth, if not the worid.
The new appiication of Wave’s technology platform as a technocratic social and economic framework (entitied Social Framework as a Service (SFaaS)), propels Wave into the political arena, which certainly impacts its value and importance.

For this reason the opportunity of a technocracy is about to be developed and explored, beginning with this memorandum for an investment of 3,000,000+ GBP - which will be received in virtual currency throughout the course of 2015. The memorandum also permits those no longer in understanding of this divestment to direct their investment to the UK aspect of this project or exit completely. Simuitaneously those who remain behind this piatforms development will gain bigger rewards as risks are reduced and returns increase.

The above mentioned countermeasures taken by Wave and its founder are also nothing in comparison to the warfare tactics being employed to defend the militarisation of this technology for use as a framework for the UTE. Much of the information of the UTE is confidential, but what can be disclosed is the initial phase which entails a network of safe houses for itseif and its members.

\subsection{\sphinxstylestrong{Conclusion}}
\label{\detokenize{overview:conclusion}}
Wave is now closer than most at making internet access free, but this can only become an inherent human right in a technocratic system of governance, under sovereign rule. The terms of this investment memorandum decree that the technology piatform being developed by Wave wiil now divide. The ‘above ground’ operation will focus soleiy on the Wi-Fi monetisation and advertising delivery solution as a UK and Caribbean company under the brand ‘Wife Eye’ using investment generated from the series A investment round, the securities exchange and usual funding sources. The less developed, more disruptive and ambitious aspects of Wave are in receipt of over 3million of Bitcoins to establish itself as a separate ‘underground’ venture. Making free internet access the gateway to a technocracy and the birth right of its members. The securities exchange will continue as an independent, open-source technoiogy project and alliance agreements between these new entities will helpful fulfill the desired outcomes of this memorandum. Operation ‘Sun Su’ briefly outlines this divvy of the investment, the division of the technology platform and the strategy and logistics moving forward.


\section{Definitions}
\label{\detokenize{overview:definitions}}

\subsection{\sphinxstylestrong{Glossary}}
\label{\detokenize{overview:glossary}}
\sphinxstylestrong{‘Seed’ Funding Round} - 2012/13: 1st funding round (R\&D). Contributed by the founder and close friends. Total Expenditure of 300,000 GBP - Estimated Value 1,250,000 GBP.

\sphinxstylestrong{‘StartUp’ Funding Round} - 2013/15: 2nd funding round. (proof of concept/alpha release). Contributed by the wider community. Total Expenditure of 500.000 GBP - Estimated Value: 4,250,000 GBP

\sphinxstylestrong{‘Series A’ Funding Round} - 2015/16: 3rd funding round to buy-out seed/startup fund investors and further develop Wave, the UTE and the Securities Exchange. A 3M GBP investment, which alongside the Series B funding round will get all four entities {[}created from this divestment), to a collective value of 50M GBP by 2017

\sphinxstylestrong{‘Series B’ Funding Round} - 2015/16: 4th funding round to help counter the Series A and measure its success. Without Series B there is no Series A - This fund will support the new divestment plan, helping four new organisations as they work to meet business and development aims and objectives - 980,000 GDP will be raised before 2016 (along Side the Series A fund), which will go some way towards ensuring this memorandums achieves its desired outcome. Series B will also act as insurance to obligations which delineate from the promise of the Series A investment instalments.

\sphinxstylestrong{UTE} - United Technocracy of Extropy. A technocratic system of governance e.g. an alternative social and economic order, which utilises Wave’s free internet access platform as a vehicle to occupy physical communications infrastructure as a gateway to a new system of governance, value exchange and resource management system. The 2014 outline business case,  entitled ‘Op Schindlers Ark’. assisted in this investment opportunity and the platforms new estimated valuation of 8.2M GBP. The UTE will work from a 2025 strategy which is currentlyr in draft.

\sphinxstylestrong{SFaaS} - Social Framework as a Service (SFaaS). A nomenclature in cloud computing devised by the Wave Telecom Team as part of the UTE Project.
A technoratic framework which acts as a base for the UTE’s alternative social and economic applications. This will be exclusive to members who willingly participate in the higher commitment experience, which will attempt to detemine each UTE society members’ value, then regulate their access to resources based on a new form of social scoring. Disputes must also be resolved using SFaaS applications. This framework is to become an effective alternative to banks, courts and similar institutions and state services.

\item {} 
\sphinxstylestrong{Default Apps}: Default SVG apps include some of the worlds first: A ciock, calender, calculator, games and notepad - all of which save data to the users social profile and rescaie to fit any device.

\item {} 
\sphinxstylestrong{Advertising (Ad) Server}: Bespoke SVG advertising platform with perform Tiance analytics, campaign management tools, get-started ad resources and a virtual currency billing module

\sphinxstylestrong{Router Firmware}: A universal, simpie-to-use, Wi-Fi router firmware upgrade wizard which is accessibie via the website to registered users. Once installed the firmware unleashes the potential of the users Wi-Fi router: enabiing it to serve ads, apps and even generate virtual currency revenue by harnessing the abundant processing power within any connected mobiie device. Funds generate from these pioneering revenue modeis are automaticaliy passed to the internet service provider aiong with the users IP, for the purposes of settling data consumption costs: the subsequent result being a free internet service for Wave users. The first release of this firmware was on the 23rd February 2015.

\item {} 
\sphinxstylestrong{UI Emulator}: An invisible HTML5 interface which the Wi-Fi router firmware places between the users web browsing window and the content being accessed online. This presents the opportunity of serving ads, mining the device for virtual currency, and through a slide menu: serves apps, hosts chat and permit webpages to be save or shared oniine with a single swipe gesture.

\item {} 
\sphinxstylestrong{RD Emulator}: Remote Desktop (RD) emuiator is the heart of Wave, so this cannot be disclosed in too much detail. However, the technology is completely bespoke to Wave. The solution was devised to overcome countermeasures taken by other oniine businesses threatened by this technology and alternative adversing soiution. One such example is x-frame and SSL. X-frame is a security measure employed by websites to purposefully prevent them appearing within frames which could ‘ciicker-jack’ e.g. manipuiate the users browsing experience beyond what the webmaster intended e.g. collect data unlawfully through deception etc. Another hurdle this technology overcomes is the manipulation of secure SSL website connections between the webmasters server and the users device. This technology tricks both the content provider and the user’s security protocols into believing the connection has not been tampered with, when actually it has been by Wave.

\item {} 
\sphinxstylestrong{mining Plugin}: This technology bolts onto the emulator an generates virtual currency revenue each time the user is accessing the web. It does this through utilising authorised connections between the users device and the web service e.g. hardware accelerator etc. Unbeknown to the userr the redundant processing power of their Wi-Fi router and all connected devices are used to process Virtual currency bank transactions. The fees paid to process these transactions are merged with the advertising revenue to help compensate ISP’s for data consumption costs.

\item {} 
\sphinxstylestrong{Securities Exchange}: The securities exchange is revolutionary. Shares certificates for our shareholders can be generate at any time based on real time virtual currency exchange rates and the fluctuating estimated value of Wave. Investors can remain anonymous while trading shares in Wave and unlike any business model before Wave, the net profits generated from this technology platform can be divided between shareholders in real time e.g. hourly, as oppose to waiting on quarterly dividend.
