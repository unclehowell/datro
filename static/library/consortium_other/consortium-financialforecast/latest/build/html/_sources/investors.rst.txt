Wave® Tokens - Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wave® Royalty Token (WRT)
--------------------------------------------

Unlike companies which distribute funds to shareholders quarterly, or yearly, the Wave® DAO is able to distribute royalties to WRT holders in real-time (daily/ hourly). 
This is achieved using Ethereum Cryptocurrency and Blockchain/ Smart Contract Technology. 
Wave® pools revenue from the networks advertisering & cryptocurreny mining activity and autonomously allocates and distributes this cryptocurrency to the wallet addresses listed on the latest WRT Master Register.

Wave® Interest Token (WIT)
----------------------------------------


The same delivery methods used to give investors in Royalty Tokens their royalties, are employed by the Wave® DAO to offer lenders real-time interest on loans made to Wave®. 
**Interest Tokens** can be used to receive real-time interest on loans, in much the same way royalties from our network are autonomously paid to Royalty Token holders.
