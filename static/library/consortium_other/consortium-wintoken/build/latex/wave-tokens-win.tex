Wave® Impact Notes™ (WIN Coins) were introduced for our Investors and Lenders as part of the Wave® Initial Coin Offering (ICO).
The 2019 ICO also included the launch of two other Tokens: The Wave® Interest Tokens™ (WIT) and Wave® Royalty Tokens™ (WRT).
This document focuses on the Wave® Impact Notes™.

WIN Accounts generate an Annual Rate of Interest (APR) of 22.5\% (subject to a minimum account deposit of £50 GBP per month).
The WIN Fund helps finance Wave® projects and initiatives which we feel will make the most impact.

WIN Coins are based on cryptocurrency Ethereum. Offering token holders freedom unlike anything a traditional currency and bank can provide.
Whether you prefer managing your money online, or through a real person by phone, you’ll be glad to know that you can manage your WIN Coins however you want.

the Securities Exchange facilitates the buying and selling of your WIN Coins.
The Securities Exchange can be located on our website ( \sphinxurl{https://wave.hotspotbnb.com} ).
Also included on our website is a free cryptocurrency wallet, for storing your WIN Coins.

To learn more about Wave® Impact Notes™, please proceed to the introduction segment of this document.

Nothing significant to report


\chapter{Introduction}
\label{\detokenize{introduction:introduction}}\label{\detokenize{introduction::doc}}
Unlike most companies, Wave® simultaniously operates its own bespoke and internal cryptocurrency banking system and services.
This new trend in tech business/ finance is most commonly refered to as a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO).
To fully understand this report, readers are advised to briefly research DAO’s online e.g. Wikipedia

\noindent\sphinxincludegraphics{{fianancials}.png}

The Wave® DAO is able to re-write this financial report each time a transaction occcurs in order it remains concurrent.
At the time of writing these reports are compiled by an administrator to check processes and proceedures before going fully autonomous.
Furthermore the DAO is able to autonomously summarise changes and place a link to the previous report in the changelog (of the most recent report).

The Wave® DAO even replaces written and signed legal agreements with encoded scripts known as cryptocurrency smart contracts.
This is handy for when our product must indentify, contracts-with and pay our customers Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) automatically.
Unique cryptographic addresses are also used to replace government issued identities to eliminate fraud and corruption.
Wave® also makes redundant conventional company shares (and promissory notes and interest payments to lenders) by issuing cryptographic ‘Royalty’ and ‘Interest’ Tokens.

Traditionally the asset (Wave®) would be owned by the company, and shares in the company would determine ownership.
In the case of Wave® a form of cryptocurrency we call ‘Wave® Royalty Tokens (WRT)’ are issued in place of shares and can be stored on the beneficiaries mobile phones (if they so desire) on free cryptocurrency wallets which are downloadble from the Wave®  website: wave.hotspotbnb.com.

True ownership of this organisations core asset is subsequently determined by whomever holds these Tokens, making shares in the company, for the best part, redundant.
The DAO is effectively affording the company the privelage of being able to administrate it, subject to preset conditions and rules e.g. the company must hold the most Royalty Tokens.

The initial sale of these Tokens is a process called Initial Coin Offering (ICO).
Details of the performance of the Tokens ICO’s can be located under the Master Registers within this document.


\section{Review \& Purchase}
\label{\detokenize{introduction:review-purchase}}
The Wave® DAO activity will appear on the Ethereum blockchain for \sphinxhref{https://ethereum.org}{public record}.

\chapter{Wave® Impact Note (WIN), 22.5\% APR}
\label{\detokenize{win-summary:wave-impact-note-win-22-5-apr}}\label{\detokenize{win-summary::doc}}
Wave® Impact Notes (WIN) are a new cryptocurrency token released in 2019.
WIN’s are currently valued at £500 GBP each.
The accounts also require a minimum deposit of £50 GBP per month to remain active.
The Annual Rate of Interest (APR) on a WIN Token account is 22.5\%.
WIT \& WRT Coins can be transfered to WIN and vice versa e.g. the cryptocurrencies can be exchanged.

Revenue from the Wave® Network was designed to distribute to ISP’s then traditionally to WRT \& WIT Coin Holders respectively through a DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation).
Unlike WRT \& WIT, the Wave® Impact Notes sits alongside the ISP’s in the DAO configuration, giving Wave® Impact Notes high priority access to the advertising and mining revenue.
