This Release (Version 0.0.0)
================================


Older Versions
=================

Inherent with the update and re-release of this report is the inclusion of a reference to a downloadable, archived copy, of the previous report. 
In the table below the last entry should display a link to an archived copy of the last report, with an archive date matching the publication of this newly published report.  
The title of the download link may differ from the filename. This is mainly to keep the filename from overflowing in the table below.
Latest releases mention the last three semantic versions only. Older versions can be located in the DATRO Consortiums `Wayback <https://wayback.datro.xyz/>`__ Archive.
