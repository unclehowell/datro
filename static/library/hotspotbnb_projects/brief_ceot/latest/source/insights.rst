CEoT Data, Analytics & Insights
====================================

The coin offering would serve as analytics in the CEoT Ecosystem to
visualise how many Things are identified as harmful for the environment.
A balance will be struck between accuracy of CEoT analytics and privacy
of custodians of the affiliated items. For example, the api requests of
the custodians software application (used to interact with the CEoT QR
Barcode) may, unless in incognito/VPN mode, disclose their country of
origin. Which can generally be presumed to be the location of the item
in question.

A visual of thE CEoT Ecosystem can coincide with the countdown clock to
see how the CEoT platform and community performs against others. Success
will slowly but surely build on success as people see tangible results
and our collective impact on the environment. Participation can occur in
much the same way a jogger will monitor his miles run, or a shopper will
try to build up and redeem points in the supermarket. A free application
will be provided which can communicate with EPoS receipts, to award
redeemable points based on the carbon labels of each product. This same
mobile application may be used to scan barcodes to display carbon labels
too.
