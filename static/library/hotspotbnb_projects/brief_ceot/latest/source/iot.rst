IoT & CEoT
-----------------

Much like the Internet of Things (IoT) whereby a device such as a lamp
can be wirelessly monitored and controlled from a smartphone, thanks to
some built in wireless relay and/or sensory devices, everyone in an
authorised chain of custody of a device (by authorised we mean those in
lawful possession of the authorisation key to interact with the NFT QR/
Barcode) as well as the actual product itself, will soon see its
QR/Barcode has been read/written too as part of the purchase/ sale/
swap.

CEoT may even be deployed to existing/ already sold devices via OTA
upgrades. Take Sensibo for example, an IR–to-Wi-Fi control unit which
sticks onto any old air conditioning unit, instantly making it a “smart”
IoT device. Sensibo would be able to remotely CEoT-enable their entire
network CEoT carbon score, which can increase as their product is used
and the energy saving it creates by efficient control of the air
condition unit is calculated.
