"Since Carbon Labelling is slow to gain traction, crowdsourcing can be "
"used, in much the same way sense.com operates, in order to estimate an "
"item's carbon label when one doesn’t exist. These crowdsourced estimates "
"can be validated with a calculation dedicated to this purpose and the "
"data sold to manufacturers and packaging companies for inclusion on their"
" products. A phase lock loop effect will quickly occur, between the end-"
"users crowdsourced estimates, the label produced based on this data, and "
"the repurchase and re-crowdsourcing of the data, combined with a "
"validating calculation. Eventually improving the real-time accuracy of "
"the carbon label on every item. The richer and more accurate the data "
"becomes the more it can be depended on for the emergence of a secondary "
"market e.g. carbon labelling tracking as an index for trades to occur on "
"or a forecast/ market research and insights platform etc."

"Both receipts contain passphrase(s) which correspond to the CEoT QR "

"the CEoT (NFT) corresponding to their Things e.g. manufacturer, estimated"
" lifespan, expiration/obsolescence  date, supply-chain of custody and "
"most notably its carbon label. An option is also displayed to take "

" generated on the CEoT, containing the field: “owner”and the entry: {the "
"wallet address holding the CEoT}. Since the siblings are now the new "

"The laptop carbon label reads 220 kg CO2e and the plants -50kg. Their "
"CEoT’s Carbon ledgers subsequently have a balance of -220 and 50 CEoTT "
"respectively. On the day the carbon clock countdown reaches zero, the "
"sister would have more of a chance of winning a major prize in the CEoT "
"prize draw, since the sisters CEoTT balance is the greater of the two. "
"Furthermore the retail value of the CEoTT has, perhaps unbeknown to the "
"siblings, was impacted by the CEoT’s."

"For example, had the siblings gone into the store to purchase their gifts"
" for each other, before the introduction of CEoT’s, the retail prices "
"would have been different. The laptop would have been £239.99 and the "
"plants would have been £259.99. This is because the manufacturer, supply "
"chains and recipients participating in the CEoT Ecosystem incur an "
"additional cost of sale for carbon producing Things, a cost they will "
"undoubtedly pass onto the consumers. Equally the same entities in the "
"supply chain which supplies  carbon zero or carbon producing products, "
"intravenously receive a subsidy for each CEoT they assign to each Thing, "
"a saving they will undoubtedly pass onto the consumer. So in effect the "
"brothers decision to purchase flowers for his sister, were at a "
"discounted rate of £10 (2.5%). And the sister's decision to purchase a "
"laptop for her brother, cost her a premium of £10 (2.5%)."

"CEoT is designed to empower every legitimate actor in the chain of "

"the Thing). CEoT is a solution to be able to easily endorse and benefit-"
"from carbon absorbing and carbon neutral Things as well as easily "
"identify, report and reject Things which cause our environment harm "
"and/or loss. The CEoT Ecosystem aims to introduce a universal protocol to"

"identifiable as cheap or expensive, but in environmental impact terms, "
"not just monetary terms. And inherently causing the former to influence "
"and perhaps even outrank the latter as part of our journey to a post-"

#~ " equipment rooms are built on private"
#~ " property and have plenty of space"
