The CEoT platform is being built on Ethereumâ€™s Loopring and zkRollup
Layer2, which on Jan 5, 2022, demonstrated an NFT collection running on
their platform, tied to the $LRC ticker and available to Loopring L2
users.

#. Loopring zkRollup now supports NFT minting, trading, and transfers,
   directly on L2
#. Any NFT minted on L2 can be withdrawn to L1
#. Both ERC1155 and ERC721 NFT token standards are supported.
#. L1 NFTs can be deposited to L2
#. No restrictions: all L2 accounts can mint NFTs
#. NFT support will be available as part of the Loopring 3.6.2 release
   end of August 2021
#. Loopring is exploring use-cases + partnerships to help bring NFTs to
   the next level on Ethereum L2
#. Using an AWS server, proofs for circuits can be generated (with 2**28
   constraints in ~7 minutes) costing ~$0.0001/trade
