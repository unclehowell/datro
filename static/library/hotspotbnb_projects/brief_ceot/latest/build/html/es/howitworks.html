<h1>How it Works<a class="headerlink" href="#how-it-works" title="Enlazar permanentemente con este título"></a></h1>
<p>Before we dive into the precise technology the CEoT ecosystem will
require in order to happen, it’s important we be clear from the offset
of our technical mandate, what we know and don’t know how to do, what we
have solutions for and what we need to figure out solutions for. This
paper has already portrayed a vision for the technology and a
non-technical mandate. We’ve already established that:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The owner of the Thing in question will need a corresponding key to
authenticate edits to the CEoT’s while the Thing is in their lawful
custody</p></li>
<li><p>The owner will need to use their corresponding key to authenticate
transfer of ownership of the Things CEoT</p></li>
<li><p>But their corresponding key should not expire, but instead its
privileges should reduce so that they may continue to edit the
destination address of where their royalties should be sent in the
event of future resales of the Thing (a feature of NFT’s which allows
previous owners, from the manufacturer(s), retailer(s) and previous
owner(s) to receive a predetermined royalty from each future resale)</p></li>
<li><p>All corresponding keys are subject to reduced privileges on the same
date as the estimated expiration date of the Thing. Thereafter the
CEoT remains on the blockchain and visible, and in the possession of
the last owner, but is no longer editable. Except maybe by the CEoT
team who’ll maintain a master key, for purposes of correcting or
transferring the CEoT tokens out of the CEoT’s ledger.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no ability for a current owner to edit previous owners”
entries</p></li>
<li><p>The wallet address of the owner is held in the CEoT when they claim
ownership as part of the transfer of ownership/ chain of custody. The
field the custodian can edit is the pseudonym of their wallet address
e.g. Amazon.com, Inc.</p></li>
<li><p>The roles and privileges of the keys are as follows:</p></li>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The NFT and blockchain technology used would need to be as green as
possible to avoid hypocrisy. Even with the advent of Etherium 2.0
which is 95% more energy efficient than Etherium 1.0 and undergoes
its merge to transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in the
first half of 2022 . Phase two, called the surge, plans to give
Ethereum increased scalability, massive bandwidth and throughput,
particularly on zk-Rollups.</p></li>
<li><p>Subsequently CEoT would not begin to be able to calculate its
Ecosystems offset of carbon emissions starting at zero. It would need
to begin its calculation at a deficit based on its own carbon
footprint of the production of the CEoT</p></li>
<li><p>An NFT sale entitled Beeple may have racked up $69.3m, but it also
generated 78.5Mg of CO₂ emissions—the same amount of electricity used
by more than 13 homes in an entire year</p></li>
<li><p>One NFT (minted on Super Rare) is equal to around 211 kg of CO₂. That
means the launch of the Palm NFT platform (which uses a centralised,
with a promise to become decentralised, Proof of Authority algorithm,
even more energy efficient than proof-of-stake) would have generated
more than 2m kg of CO₂, the equivalent of 432 cars being driven for a
year</p></li>
<li><p>To put this into perspective, the Oatly carbon label solution says
that the carbon footprint of each carton of oat milk is 0.41kg
CO2e/kg</p></li>
<li><p>where CO2e/kg is the greenhouse gas emissions per kilogramme of
product, converted to an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide (carbon
dioxide equivalents or CO2e</p></li>
<li><p>This is the standard unit for measuring carbon footprints so that
they can be compared. But how many shoppers would know this and, more
to the point, is 0.41kg CO2e/kg a high or low figure</p></li>
<li><p>Here is where the emergence of CEoT becomes interesting. Because only
in 2022 is an NFT able to be created with a minimal carbon footprint.
And with the rise of trends like laser engraving and other
technological advantages which could see CEoT go mainstream, a
cruiciendo is reached where CEoT-enabling a pint of milk, becomes
fathomly feasible to do.</p></li>
<li><p>Each NFT generated by the CEoT Ecosystem will have generated a
corresponding authentication key to make edits. When a manufacturer
ships to a wholesaler or retailer, or end-user directly (internet
long tail), the privileges of the manufacturer’s corresponding key
will be reduced to, say, only editing their address for any future
royalties. And the new owner will have a new key generated for them
upon handover/takeover in order they be able to manage the NFT, but
only where it concerns their phase of the chain of custody.</p></li>
<li><p>If owner 1 sells or transfers a CEoT-enabled Thing to a new owner,
owner 1’s key will be the one authorising the generation of a new
owner key, and in such an even the previous owners key reduces in
privileges. This is a core feature of the smart contract of the NFT
and what makes CEoT what it is. Furthermore a new owner entry is made
in the NFT to represent the new custodian and it is only this owner
entry the custodian can amend.</p></li>
<li><p>CEoT (the NFT the QR-Code refers to) will contain a ledger, a kind of
wallet of its own, which will be able to hold a number of
cryptocurrency tokens equal in volume to the carbon label
reading/scoring of the Thing:</p></li>
<li><p>The ledger on the CEoT will always be an inversion of the carbon
label reading/scoring. And will always be divisible by 1,000 CEoTT’s
(Tokens):</p></li>
<li><p>So if a pint of milk has a carbon label of 0.41kg CO2e/kg and a pint
weighs 0.49 kg, the pint of milk has a carbon footprint of 0.2kg. Or
in the case of the corresponding CEoT’s built in ledger, its balance
will be set at negative 0.2 CEoTT.</p></li>
<li><p>In carbon neutral products and carbon absorbing ones, the carbon
scoring will be a 0 or minus. Say a 0.49g pack of grass seeds with a
Carbon Score of -0.2kg CO2e/kg ( a minus since it’s a carbon
absorbing Thing). The CEoT ledger will begin with a positive balance
of 0.2 CEoTT.</p></li>
<li><p>The CEoTT ledger is actually a sum total of two ledgers. A CEoTT
positive ledger, which can only hold CEoT positive Tokens (CEoTT+)
and a CEoTT negative ledger, which can only hold CEoT negative Tokens
(CEoTT+). In essence this allows for supply of a negative balance
token as well as a positive one.</p></li>
<li><p>Another point to mention is that a zero balance in CEoT is actually
not true zero. In much the way zero celcius and farenheit vary. The
reason for this is that there must be some reward for a carbon zero
Thing. This variant is also logarithmic so that it eventually
corrects in both directions. The logarithm itself is still being
determined, so the below table is only an illustration. And to
simplify the examples in this whitepaper all references to the CEoT
ledger will use true zero.</p></li>

<li><p>The fee charged when making entries and changes to a CEoT with a
ledger balance of 0.2 CEoT Tokens, will be 0.2 CEoT Tokens. The
custodian’s wallet is what is charged.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The only thing able to adjust the ledgers on the CEoT’s will be the
CEoT’s Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO).  Adjustments may
be proposed, voted on and executed, such as “tolerance” e.g. +/- 10%.
In much the same way the countdown clock was just adjusted by almost
9%, so too could the carbon labelling value of everything in the ECoT
ecosystem be corrected by a small percentage. Say if the carbon
calculation formula is updated.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>When a CEoT’s ledger balance is -0.2  CEoT Tokens and the owner
gains lawful possession of the corresponding, carbon absorbing
Thing, their wallet is rewarded with 0.2 CEoT Tokens.  The CEoT can
store many fields of information, such as the weight of a Thing. And
applications interacting with the CEoT can perform calculations such
as converting the CO2e/kg unit of measure to a more easily readable
format that makes more sense e.g. Carbon Footprint = 0.2kg (of
Carbon into the atmosphere, during lifespan of the Thing).</p></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>The CEoT Tokens contained “in each Thing” are not redeemable but if</dt><dd><p>they are made redeemable it should not be before the climate goals
are met and/or the carbon countdown clock reaches zero. In which
case they will serve as collectibles and/or memorabilia and hold
information about participants in the fulfilment of  the goals.</p>
