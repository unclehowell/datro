Augmented Packaging & Labelling
===================================

Interacting with products displaying QR Codes might be more possible
today than even thanks to smart watches, phones and other devices which
can scan the QR Code and display the content of the corresponding NFT
e.g. Carbon Label/ Scoring, Manufacturer, Supplier etc onto the actual
Item. This process of augmenting the information can even playback cctv
video snippets from the NFT, of the Items entire journey, all the way
from the manufacturer to the self it’s sitting on. Or better still,
shopping online you’d see the journey all the way into the Amazon
warehouse where the item is sitting safely, waiting to be ordered. More
assuring than a string of track and trace numbers, which requires more
faith and gives less assurance to the consumer. Technically speaking you
could engrave a McDonald's hamburger with the same feature, so the
customer can skip through surveillance of it reaching them, to ensure
everyone handling their meal meets their hygiene standards.
