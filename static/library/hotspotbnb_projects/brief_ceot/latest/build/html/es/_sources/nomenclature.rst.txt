CEoT Nomenclature
======================

The letter ‘o’ followed by the capital letter ‘T’ is part of an
established group of nomenclatures ending in the phrase “of Things”,
which became commonly understood with the rise of the “Internet of
Things `[6] <#CleanEnergyofThings(CEoT).xhtml#id.1bc63erel7mf>`__ ”. It
has since been used in other contexts including “Blockchain of Things”,
“Web of Things” and more. And in the case of this whitepaper: Clean
Energy of Things (CEoT).
