Summary
=============

Various hardware and software solutions are being deployed to
manufacturers, supply chains, retailers and consumers, but the solutions
are all very fragmented with a lot of different goals moving in very
different directions. There is no standard, universal protocol or
procedure in place as yet. The CEoT Exchange, Tokens and overall
Ecosystem expects to be more inclusive since it incorporates so many of
the different hardware and software solutions in this space, such as
laser etching/ engraving, QR codes, carbon labelling, blockchain and
NFTâ€™s and more. The result is a common goal and direction and time
frame. CEoT also fully complies with industry standard carbon labelling
practises, such as ISO 14067, PAS 2050, PAS 2060 and GHG Protocol. Not
to mention web technology standards and practises e.g. ERC-721 , ERC-20
etc
