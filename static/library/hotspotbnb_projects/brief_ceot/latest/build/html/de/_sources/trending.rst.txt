Trending CEoT
==================

Many years ago David Cameron, the former Prime Minister of the UK (of
all people) tried but failed to get UK Citizens to share their energy
data with each other to encourage some vanity and pride over the use of
green energy and savings using smart technologies, even before IoT
gained traction and became a multi-billion pound market sector

be able to succeed where this British Government's vision failed. CEoT
will empower regular people to have a clear visual of the carbon rating
of the products we consume. Which can easily be compared to community
averages to see if you are underperforming or overachieving based on the
carbon labels of the Things you purchase, without actually disclosing
your purchases. Furthermore CEoT-Ready items act as a simple points
system, whereby the number of CEoT points (cryptocurrency tokens/coins)
supplied with the item at the Point of Sale (PoS), and equate in volume
to the Carbon Label reading, instead of the R.R.P of an item, which
serve as a sort of shares certificate, generating royalties which can be
exchanged for other crypto or fiat currencies.
