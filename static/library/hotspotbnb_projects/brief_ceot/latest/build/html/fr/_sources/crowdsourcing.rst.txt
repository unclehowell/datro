Crowdsourcing
===============

Since Carbon Labelling is slow to gain traction, crowdsourcing can be
used, in much the same way sense.com operates, in order to estimate an
item's carbon label when one doesnâ€™t exist. These crowdsourced estimates
can be validated with a calculation dedicated to this purpose and the
data sold to manufacturers and packaging companies for inclusion on
their products. A phase lock loop effect will quickly occur, between the
end-users crowdsourced estimates, the label produced based on this data,
and the repurchase and re-crowdsourcing of the data, combined with a
validating calculation. Eventually improving the real-time accuracy of
the carbon label on every item. The richer and more accurate the data
becomes the more it can be depended on for the emergence of a secondary
market e.g. carbon labelling tracking as an index for trades to occur on
or a forecast/ market research and insights platform etc.
