How it Works
=====================

Before we dive into the precise technology the CEoT ecosystem will
require in order to happen, it's important we be clear from the offset
of our technical mandate, what we know and don’t know how to do, what we
have solutions for and what we need to figure out solutions for. This
paper has already portrayed a vision for the technology and a
non-technical mandate. We’ve already established that:

#. The owner of the Thing in question will need a corresponding key to
   authenticate edits to the CEoT’s while the Thing is in their lawful
   custody

#. The owner will need to use their corresponding key to authenticate
   transfer of ownership of the Things CEoT

#. But their corresponding key should not expire, but instead its
   privileges should reduce so that they may continue to edit the
   destination address of where their royalties should be sent in the
   event of future resales of the Thing (a feature of NFT’s which allows
   previous owners, from the manufacturer(s), retailer(s) and previous
   owner(s) to receive a predetermined royalty from each future resale)

#. All corresponding keys are subject to reduced privileges on the same
   date as the estimated expiration date of the Thing. Thereafter the
   CEoT remains on the blockchain and visible, and in the possession of
   the last owner, but is no longer editable. Except maybe by the CEoT
   team who’ll maintain a master key, for purposes of correcting or
   transferring the CEoT tokens out of the CEoT’s ledger.

#. There is no ability for a current owner to edit previous owners'
   entries

#. The wallet address of the owner is held in the CEoT when they claim
   ownership as part of the transfer of ownership/ chain of custody. The
   field the custodian can edit is the pseudonym of their wallet address
   e.g. Amazon.com, Inc.

#. The roles and privileges of the keys are as follows:

Table 1.0 - Role and Privileges of Keys

| Beneficiary | Current Holder/ Custodian  - Active editing of the    |
|             | active segment                                        |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Trustee     | Ownership reverts to beneficiary and key is           |

#. The NFT and blockchain technology used would need to be as green as
   possible to avoid hypocrisy. Even with the advent of Etherium 2.0
   which is 95% more energy efficient than Etherium 1.0 and undergoes
   its merge to transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in the
   first half of 2022 . Phase two, called the surge, plans to give
   Ethereum increased scalability, massive bandwidth and throughput,
   particularly on zk-Rollups.

#. Subsequently CEoT would not begin to be able to calculate its
   Ecosystems offset of carbon emissions starting at zero. It would need
   to begin its calculation at a deficit based on its own carbon
   footprint of the production of the CEoT

#. An NFT sale entitled Beeple may have racked up $69.3m, but it also
   generated 78.5Mg of CO₂ emissions—the same amount of electricity used
   by more than 13 homes in an entire year

#. One NFT (minted on Super Rare) is equal to around 211 kg of CO₂. That
   means the launch of the Palm NFT platform (which uses a centralised,
   with a promise to become decentralised, Proof of Authority algorithm,
   even more energy efficient than proof-of-stake) would have generated
   more than 2m kg of CO₂, the equivalent of 432 cars being driven for a
   year
#. To put this into perspective, the Oatly carbon label solution says
   that the carbon footprint of each carton of oat milk is 0.41kg
   CO2e/kg

#. where CO2e/kg is the greenhouse gas emissions per kilogramme of
   product, converted to an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide (carbon
   dioxide equivalents or CO2e
#. This is the standard unit for measuring carbon footprints so that
   they can be compared. But how many shoppers would know this and, more
   to the point, is 0.41kg CO2e/kg a high or low figure
#. Here is where the emergence of CEoT becomes interesting. Because only
   in 2022 is an NFT able to be created with a minimal carbon footprint.
   And with the rise of trends like laser engraving and other
   technological advantages which could see CEoT go mainstream, a
   cruiciendo is reached where CEoT-enabling a pint of milk, becomes
   fathomly feasible to do.

#. Each NFT generated by the CEoT Ecosystem will have generated a
   corresponding authentication key to make edits. When a manufacturer
   ships to a wholesaler or retailer, or end-user directly (internet
   long tail), the privileges of the manufacturer's corresponding key
   will be reduced to, say, only editing their address for any future
   royalties. And the new owner will have a new key generated for them
   upon handover/takeover in order they be able to manage the NFT, but
   only where it concerns their phase of the chain of custody.

#. If owner 1 sells or transfers a CEoT-enabled Thing to a new owner,
   owner 1’s key will be the one authorising the generation of a new
   owner key, and in such an even the previous owners key reduces in
   privileges. This is a core feature of the smart contract of the NFT
   and what makes CEoT what it is. Furthermore a new owner entry is made
   in the NFT to represent the new custodian and it is only this owner
   entry the custodian can amend.

#. CEoT (the NFT the QR-Code refers to) will contain a ledger, a kind of
   wallet of its own, which will be able to hold a number of
   cryptocurrency tokens equal in volume to the carbon label
   reading/scoring of the Thing:

#. The ledger on the CEoT will always be an inversion of the carbon
   label reading/scoring. And will always be divisible by 1,000 CEoTT’s
   (Tokens):

#. So if a pint of milk has a carbon label of 0.41kg CO2e/kg and a pint
   weighs 0.49 kg, the pint of milk has a carbon footprint of 0.2kg. Or
   in the case of the corresponding CEoT’s built in ledger, its balance
   will be set at negative 0.2 CEoTT.
#. In carbon neutral products and carbon absorbing ones, the carbon
   scoring will be a 0 or minus. Say a 0.49g pack of grass seeds with a
   Carbon Score of -0.2kg CO2e/kg ( a minus since it’s a carbon
   absorbing Thing). The CEoT ledger will begin with a positive balance
   of 0.2 CEoTT.
#. The CEoTT ledger is actually a sum total of two ledgers. A CEoTT
   positive ledger, which can only hold CEoT positive Tokens (CEoTT+)
   and a CEoTT negative ledger, which can only hold CEoT negative Tokens
   (CEoTT+). In essence this allows for supply of a negative balance
   token as well as a positive one.
#. Another point to mention is that a zero balance in CEoT is actually
   not true zero. In much the way zero celcius and farenheit vary. The
   reason for this is that there must be some reward for a carbon zero
   Thing. This variant is also logarithmic so that it eventually
   corrects in both directions. The logarithm itself is still being
   determined, so the below table is only an illustration. And to
   simplify the examples in this whitepaper all references to the CEoT
   ledger will use true zero.  

Table 1.1 - CEoT Logarithmic (Illustration Only)

============ === == === === = ==== === === == ===
Carbon Score -11 .. -1  0   1 2    3   4   .. 11
CEoT Ledger  11  .. 2.5 1.7 0 -2.5 3.7 4.9 .. -11
============ === == === === = ==== === === == ===

#. The fee charged when making entries and changes to a CEoT with a
   ledger balance of 0.2 CEoT Tokens, will be 0.2 CEoT Tokens. The
   custodian's wallet is what is charged.

-  The only thing able to adjust the ledgers on the CEoT’s will be the
   CEoT’s Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO).  Adjustments may
   be proposed, voted on and executed, such as “tolerance” e.g. +/- 10%.
   In much the same way the countdown clock was just adjusted by almost
   9%, so too could the carbon labelling value of everything in the ECoT
   ecosystem be corrected by a small percentage. Say if the carbon
   calculation formula is updated.

#.  When a CEoT’s ledger balance is -0.2  CEoT Tokens and the owner
    gains lawful possession of the corresponding, carbon absorbing
    Thing, their wallet is rewarded with 0.2 CEoT Tokens.  The CEoT can
    store many fields of information, such as the weight of a Thing. And
    applications interacting with the CEoT can perform calculations such
    as converting the CO2e/kg unit of measure to a more easily readable
    format that makes more sense e.g. Carbon Footprint = 0.2kg (of
    Carbon into the atmosphere, during lifespan of the Thing).

#. The CEoT Tokens contained “in each Thing” are not redeemable but if
    they are made redeemable it should not be before the climate goals
    are met and/or the carbon countdown clock reaches zero. In which
    case they will serve as collectibles and/or memorabilia and hold
    information about participants in the fulfilment of  the goals.
