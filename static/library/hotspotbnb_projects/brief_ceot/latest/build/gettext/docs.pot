msgid "Since Carbon Labelling is slow to gain traction, crowdsourcing can be used, in much the same way sense.com operates, in order to estimate an item's carbon label when one doesn’t exist. These crowdsourced estimates can be validated with a calculation dedicated to this purpose and the data sold to manufacturers and packaging companies for inclusion on their products. A phase lock loop effect will quickly occur, between the end-users crowdsourced estimates, the label produced based on this data, and the repurchase and re-crowdsourcing of the data, combined with a validating calculation. Eventually improving the real-time accuracy of the carbon label on every item. The richer and more accurate the data becomes the more it can be depended on for the emergence of a secondary market e.g. carbon labelling tracking as an index for trades to occur on or a forecast/ market research and insights platform etc."

msgid "The tokens held on the ledger relates to the carbon scoring of the Thing. As part of the CEoT Ecosystem system and its launch, the unique address of the CEoT can be advertised with a QR Code, which can be easily added to virtual and real-world Things. There are several ways to reduce the negligence, incompetence or manipulation of multiple Things QR Codes refering to the same CEoT. Otherwise they’d be no better than the barcodes used for the last 50+ years. CEoT also seeks to solve multiple CEoT’s referring to the same Thing. It’s now technically possible to reference snippets of CCTV footage in the CEoT, to playback video footage corresponding to the specific Things' entire journey from its manufacture to the moment it arrives in your hand. This growing ability to validify the chain of custody of the Thing is, in the case of this whitepaper's objectives, only restricted by the hypocrisy of the growing carbon footprint this feature would cause. But as the gap between current carbon emission and carbon zero shrinks, so too will the feasibility of making the CEoT-Ready Thing and its corresponding CEoT record inseparable."

msgid "“CEoT In Thing”  doesn’t mean the Thing hosts a node that contains a unique CEoT. Without breaking much of a sweat, IoT capabilities in Things could achieve this, perhaps using Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) and Near Field Communications (NFC) to ensure maximum uptime for synchronisation with the blockchain and offline intractability. But the bandwidth of USSD and other factors between now and the carbon countdown clock deadline, doesn’t permit this or  is so challenging at his juncture, that complication and perhaps failure appears to be inevitable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/definitions.rst:48
msgid "In the interim the CEoT Ecosystem will instead exist on the Loopring/ Ethereum blockchain online for added security, better bandwidth, adoptability, support etc. But this isn’t to say that CEoT won't be able to source a web3.0 device which would connect into the Thing owner's wireless access point, so the general public have an almost physical possession of the CEoT’s which correspond to the Things in their possession. In fact, by simply adding mesh capabilities between neighbours there would be no more need for any web2.0 infrastructure, not even the ISP. But this migration should perhaps be explored after 2028 since more centralised infrastructure running on greener energy and using more efficient industrial scale energy saving techniques are far better for our current greenhouse-gas emission goals than depending the CEoT Ecosystem on residential end-users, with less efficient residential-grade energy saving solutions or bandwidth."

msgid "Tradeoffs like this, perhaps not all so sovereign in nature, will need to be considered to ensure the 2028 deadline is priority and not the ego of technical supremacy. One example of this is the Palm NFT platform which has chosen to use a centralised Proof of Authority algorithm `[11] <#CleanEnergyofThings(CEoT).xhtml#id.1bc63erel7mf>`__  which is even more energy efficient than proof-of-stake. Although efforts are being made to decentralise their Proof of Authority algorithm, it’s somewhat a better priority to have, in light of the approaching carbon clock deadline, than prioritising decentralisation which is currently worse for the environment."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/definitions.rst:74
msgid "Both environmental impact and architectural integrity, particularly security, are paradoxical when it comes to prioritising them, because poor structural integrity could jeopardise the CEoT Ecosystem from ever fulfilling its goal in time for the 2028 deadline, but equally what is the point of having such a durable and rigorous ecosystem if in doing so it defeats its own objective by having a carbon footprint which could have been avoided. Striking a balance is even an understatement because we will miss our window. Environmental impact must be a non-negotiable top priority for the next 6 years. And this is why the tradeoff is made to describe the CEoT being “in the Thing” when it's actually not technically physically in it, we’re just trusting people in the manufacturing process and supply chain to be diligent in their duties. It’s either that or we exhaust resources and raise our carbon footprint to catalogue and survey the Thing, from cradle to grave, to try to absolutely ensure a bad actor doesn’t corrupt or manipulate the CEoT Ecosystem and data. So yes, eggs will be broken in this race to make our CEoT omelette, but its floor, quite literally, will be cleaned after the carbon clock strikes zero."

Sometimes bad actors will swap barcodes on items at stores to deceive the cashier and get a lower price on a similar product with more features. In the case of CEoT’s NFT QR-Codes, it wouldn’t be very feasible, effective or disruptive for bad actors to tamper with individual Clean Energy Things even if they were stuck onto the Thing and not engraved."

msgid "What is interesting is that fruit and vegetables can now be laser engraved. While this new method promises a positive environmental impact due to the reduced level of packaging required, or the need to peel a gluey-goo barcode from fresh fruit before you eat it. And the method claims not to accelerate the expiration date of the fruit or vegetable. It still doesn’t tackle the problem of carbon labelling, which would traditionally be on the packaging alongside other labels such as the manufacturer's brand and the ingredients and allergy warnings e.g. contains nuts, dairy etc. On an apple for example, it would resemble an old graffitied wall. So the answer is a QR-Code containing all the aforementioned information, and at a stretch perhaps the brand logo. Until our planet's needs are met and the threats to our planet are curbed, carbon labelling may need to have equal if not more emphasis than the Items retail price."

This process of augmenting the information can even playback cctv video snippets from the NFT, of the Items entire journey, all the way from the manufacturer to the self it’s sitting on. Or better still, shopping online you’d see the journey all the way into the Amazon warehouse where the item is sitting safely, waiting to be ordered. More assuring than a string of track and trace numbers, which requires more faith and gives less assurance to the consumer. Technically speaking you could engrave a McDonald's hamburger with the same feature, so the customer can skip through surveillance of it reaching them, to ensure everyone handling their meal meets their hygiene standards."

msgid "In Britain a brother and sister of the Griffiths family, decide to buy each other gifts. They set each other a budget of exactly £249.99. The brother buys his sister a collection of exotic flowers and the sister buys a new laptop for her brother."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/scenario.rst:9
msgid "Both receipts contain passphrase(s) which correspond to the CEoT QR code(s) laser-engraved onto the gifts. When the siblings scan the QR Code on their Things, they’re taken to a CEoT layer 2 web app which displays the CEoT (NFT) corresponding to their Things e.g. manufacturer, estimated lifespan, expiration/obsolescence  date, supply-chain of custody and most notably its carbon label. An option is also displayed to take ownership of the CEoT by entering the passphrase. Which the siblings do."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/scenario.rst:18
msgid "The first thing that occurs after the siblings claim possession of the CEoT is the privileges of the keys of the retailer(s), reduces  from Beneficiary to Vestee. The second thing which happens is a new segment is generated on the CEoT, containing the field: “owner”and the entry: {the wallet address holding the CEoT}. Since the siblings are now the new custodians e.g. holders of a key with beneficiary privileges, they are able to display a pseudonym in place of their wallet address e.g. Griffiths Family Estate."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/scenario.rst:27
msgid "The laptop carbon label reads 220 kg CO2e and the plants -50kg. Their CEoT’s Carbon ledgers subsequently have a balance of -220 and 50 CEoTT respectively. On the day the carbon clock countdown reaches zero, the sister would have more of a chance of winning a major prize in the CEoT prize draw, since the sisters CEoTT balance is the greater of the two. Furthermore the retail value of the CEoTT has, perhaps unbeknown to the siblings, was impacted by the CEoT’s."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/scenario.rst:35
msgid "For example, had the siblings gone into the store to purchase their gifts for each other, before the introduction of CEoT’s, the retail prices would have been different. The laptop would have been £239.99 and the plants would have been £259.99. This is because the manufacturer, supply chains and recipients participating in the CEoT Ecosystem incur an additional cost of sale for carbon producing Things, a cost they will undoubtedly pass onto the consumers. Equally the same entities in the supply chain which supplies  carbon zero or carbon producing products, intravenously receive a subsidy for each CEoT they assign to each Thing, a saving they will undoubtedly pass onto the consumer. So in effect the brothers decision to purchase flowers for his sister, were at a discounted rate of £10 (2.5%). And the sister's decision to purchase a laptop for her brother, cost her a premium of £10 (2.5%)."

msgid "Acid/Alkaline food and drinks are a prime example of where supermarkets are a dis-service when it comes to our health. A majority of foods and drinks in supermarkets are petrochemical or acidic or synthesised with unnatural preservatives and even RNA pesticides engineered into crops in order to shut down a bugs nervous system and kill them. Our absolute nativity thinking washing fruit and vegetables will keep our bodies pure."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/spendingchoices.rst:12
msgid "In much the same way, hopefully looking back and not forward, supermarkets are as much a dis-service when it comes to the carbon footprint of a food or drink on sale. While all sorts of agendas may be in play, the consumer must be empowered to have transparency and not blind(-folded) trust, so that we may make our own uncorrupted, informative judgments of what we wish to purchase or not. Mobile applications that can scan the product and labelling on Things which display the content are assets in this regard. However a standard supermarket has become some seriously dangerous and difficult waters to navigate if you want to avoid petrochemicals, RNA, acids, pharmaceuticals, sugars, synthetics, GMO’s and other conveniences to the supply chain at the cost of your health."

msgid "Unlawful but completely legal false advertising is an ever greater gateway to hell. For example 100% Fruit Juice means one of the ingredients of an artificial drink contains real fruit. And what about French Truffles, which means the packaging was made in france. Or that cola, used as a pesticide in some regions of the world, is alone in its own category at the bottom of the absolute worst and most harmful acidic a human body can consume. What possesses us to repeatedly abuse and destroy our body in the same way we’ve been destroying our home planet, is ultimately our social conditioning. Those stealing our liberty to harvest us of our power,  brainwash masses to make management and control of us easier on themselves. Before even thinking of trying to save our home, we must first save ourselves."

msgid "Those who buy farm fresh or grow their own food may be the first to endorse the CEoT Ecosystem. Now we are in the age of the prosumer, home based business owners effectively sell their ideological and pure Things direct to other proactive, environmentally conscious types. Who for the most part may have lost all faith in Governments and Corporations to better this world over lining their pockets and furthering their political agendas. If anything the supermarket's could break out of the norm of a web of deceitful, poisonous products, conveyor-belt fed to radicalised sugar jihaddy junkies and use CEoT to reinvent themselves and stock their shelves and price their products based on what is perhaps the current most ethical metric of this new decade."

msgid "Various hardware and software solutions are being deployed to manufacturers, supply chains, retailers and consumers, but the solutions are all very fragmented with a lot of different goals moving in very different directions. There is no standard, universal protocol or procedure in place as yet. The CEoT Exchange, Tokens and overall Ecosystem expects to be more inclusive since it incorporates so many of the different hardware and software solutions in this space, such as laser etching/ engraving, QR codes, carbon labelling, blockchain and NFT’s and more. The result is a common goal and direction and time frame. CEoT also fully complies with industry standard carbon labelling practises, such as ISO 14067, PAS 2050, PAS 2060 and GHG Protocol. Not to mention web technology standards and practises e.g. ERC-721 , ERC-20 etc"

msgid "This CEoT Whitepaper discusses the concept of CEoT: A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) featuring a built-in \"Inverse Carbon Label\" Ledger. Made visible using QR Codes, that can be easily added to literally, all Things. And fully editable using corresponding and authorised, cryptographic keys. CEoT is designed to empower every legitimate actor in the chain of custody of Things (from manufacturing to end-user use and enjoyment of the Thing). CEoT is a solution to be able to easily endorse and benefit-from carbon absorbing and carbon neutral Things as well as easily identify, report and reject Things which cause our environment harm and/or loss. The CEoT Ecosystem aims to introduce a universal protocol to all newly manufactured and even pre-existing Things to ensure they're identifiable as cheap or expensive, but in environmental impact terms, not just monetary terms. And inherently causing the former to influence and perhaps even outrank the latter as part of our journey to a post-information, resource based economy. CEoT is expected to cause a sharp turn in consumer spending, away from environmentally unfriendly Things and towards carbon absorbing and neutral Things `[7] <#CleanEnergyofThings(CEoT).xhtml#id.1bc63erel7mf>`__ . Combined with other initiatives `[8] <#CleanEnergyofThings(CEoT).xhtml#id.1bc63erel7mf>`__ , CEoT's have the potential to cause the movement required in consumer spending which is needed to increase the likelihood of a slow down (and eventual stop) of the current rise in carbon emission, before the climate clock reaches zero."

CEoT may be able to succeed where this British Government's vision failed. CEoT will empower regular people to have a clear visual of the carbon rating of the products we consume. Which can easily be compared to community averages to see if you are underperforming or overachieving based on the carbon labels of the Things you purchase, without actually disclosing your purchases. Furthermore CEoT-Ready items act as a simple points system, whereby the number of CEoT points (cryptocurrency tokens/coins) supplied with the item at the Point of Sale (PoS), and equate in volume to the Carbon Label reading, instead of the R.R.P of an item, which serve as a sort of shares certificate, generating royalties which can be exchanged for other crypto or fiat currencies."
