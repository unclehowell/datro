Buyer Must Remain in LOT Network for Two Years
================================================

Pursuant to Section 3.3 of this Agreement, Buyer is obligated to maintain itself as a member in good standing of the LOT Network for a period of at least two years from the Closing. 

Reversion to Google
========================

In the event that Buyer fails to maintain itself as a member in good standing in the LOT Network during the two-year period following the Closing other than for reasons related to the Buyer filing for bankruptcy, all Patents aquired as part of the Agreement by Buyer from Seller ("Reverted Patents") automatically revert back to Seller. Such reverter is automatic and requires no additional consideration on the part of the Seller. 


No Licence Back to Buyer
============================

In the event of a reverter back to Seller under this Section, Google is under no obligation to grant Buyer a license to the Reverted Patents. Any licenses entered into by Buyer purporting to cover the Buyer or its affiliates shall be deemed null and void. Buyer agrees that any licenses it makes after taking ownership of the Patents will be subject to this Provision. 



Pursuant to Section 3.3 of this Agreement, Buyer is obligated to maintain itself as a member in good standing of the LOT Network for a period of at least two years from the Closing.
