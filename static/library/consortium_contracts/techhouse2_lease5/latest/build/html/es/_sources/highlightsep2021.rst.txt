Highlight Report (Sep 2021)
==============================


Plan vs Performance (Sep 2021)
######################################

- Tenancy Agreement IV (2020/21) expires August 31st 2021. 
- Owners report to tenant the apartment is selling. And they're discussing renewing tenancy.
- Owners send written notice to tenant about contract expiration. 


**Tenant Offer**

|

- Tenant offers to pay final 2 months (Jul/Aug) e.g. $1k.  
- Tenant asks 1 more month to make payment on the 28th (as has been the case since April 2018). Before switching to paying on the 1st of the month. 
- Repair work to be handled by Tenant during new tenancy.  


**Owner Counter-Offer**

|

**Aug-31** - Owner demands payment for new contract be made before the 15th in the first month. 
             And the contract be 6 months, not 12 months. 

Contract 0.0.0 - tenant loses deposit if tenant gives notice to leave
               - tenants deposit cant be used for rent, only repairs
             
 
Issues, Risks, Concerns (Aug/Sep 2021)
##########################################

**2021-Sep-16*  - Owner produced a receipt, ahead of any payment, saying payment is for missing payment. 
                - This will mean the Tenants payment for September for the new contract, 
                  will be allocated to a "missing payment" relating to the old contract - leaving September payment outstanding.
                  In addition, October will be due on the 1st October. So After paying $1k for July/Aug, And another $500 for September, used instead for a missing payment ($1500 in total), 
                  a further payment is expected to be demanded for September and October (a further $1k). And the repair work is being quoted. An additional $1k. 
                  That's $1k Aug + $500 Sep/"missing payment" + $1k Sep/Oct + $1k repair = That's $3,500 the landlord is expecting, in the space of a few weeks. 
                  In fact,  funds for a month of the old contract was borrowed. So the lender has to be paid back and the landlord wants paying again. That's an additional cost of $1k. 
                  So $4,500 in the space of a few weeks. Extortion !!!
 
                - Landlord has not specified which month a payment was missed on the old contract. Only that a payment is missing. 

**2021-Sep-16** - Tenant wishes to further query the Owners alledged "missing payment" from the last contract. Which month ? 
                - Dispute the use of the first payment of the new contract for this alledged mysterious "missing payment".
                - Condition of the $1k sent on the 30th Aug was that is was for final settlement of the old contract. It's even specified on the bank transfer.


Plans Moving Forward (Oct 2021)
#####################################


                - Solve the mystery of the missing payment once and for all
                - At least differ the matter, treat it as a seperate matter - since it's being disputed. 
                - Not write receipts ahead of payment saying that's what the payment is for, when it is not. That's not honourable.  

                - Sign a contact. v0.0.0 is not acceptable to the tenant. Which is why the tenant has redrafted the agreement (v0.0.1).
                
                - Waiver or discount the $65 fee for the contract, since it was poorly written and the tenant had to do work on it too. 
                -
