msgid "In any case, use of these h3 references isn't something which can be exclusively owned and controlled. So how to we overcome this challenge ? Enter Handshake. To understand Handshake its best to first understand Top Level Domains (TLD's). TLD's are unique in nature e.g. dot com (.com) for example is only able to be possesed by a single entity at any one time. If two entities both provided the TLD .com at the same time, how would a network know which party's .com to direct traffic to when someone enteres a .com url into their browser ? .com used to be owned by the United States Department of Defense, but today it's operated by Verisign. Until Handshake came along, you could only obtain a TLD through an expensive and lengthy processes ($130k - $180k and 6+ months) with ICANN (which also offered no guarentees). The Handshake platform has democratised and cheapened this process through what is known as a candle auction. Now registration only takes a few dollars and a couple of days."

For this price the Scottish Bay alone will generate in the region of circa $1.4M USD of digital real estate inventory for the consortium to sell. The area is defined by the 70km width of the coastline and the depth is inland as far as the west/southern boundaries of the two provinces which make up the Scottish Bay. The services and nodes inside each dome effectively become lessee's, using cryptocurrency smart contracts to lease use and enjoyment of the Bloculus protocol. The proceeds of which will pool together and divide proportionately between the protocols lessors/ beneficiaries. Henceforth the Scottish Bay will become the first of many estates, of this new protocol. Furthermore, the web3.0 services and nodes on this new fixed communications network, are expected to be the first of many types of digital lessee's which will pay to use the Bloculus protocol."

#: ../../source/executivesummary.rst:101
msgid "It's recommended the consortium expand on this business case and produce a dedicated whitepaper on the technology. It would be wise to purchase the Scottish Bay's entire H3 references as TLD's, ahead of competing party. Then select future regions of the world to ringfence H3/TLD's for use with this protocol. The retail rate of co-ownership of the preceeding estate, should help towards this growing capital requirement, failing this investors maybe interested in financing this initiative."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/executivesummary.rst:106

HotspotBnB is ultimately just a webserver designed to run on a low energy/ low cost single board computers e.g. Raspberry Pi. The operating system autonomously self-builds and configures. And can do so without an active internet connection (using another DATRO solution called Cacher)"

HotspotBnB can also be used to manage a Geodesic Equipment Room if the physical location (in H3/ resolution 8 format) is pre-selected in order to include the H3-TLD inside the OS.

#: ../../source/executivesummary.rst:130
msgid "This protocol is justified from both a technical and business standpoint. The alternatives aren't half as effective and have limitations which this protocol overcomes. Furthermore this is a new generation of communications network and so a new protocol has had to be developed specifically because the existing technologies didn't suffice. The Bloculus protocol is designed for a reality of automation, decentralization, anonymity, cryptographic security, currency and tokenized voting/ liquid democracy."

msgid "The vision of web3.0 (in the eyes of DATRO in anycase) are wi-fi access points which host all webservices as decentralized (federated) localhost progressive webapps. There is subsequently no central point of control or central service provider. Furthermore the network meshes, so even the concept of an ISP becomes exstinct (see althea.net) Furthermore this access point software (able to host the abovemonetioned webapps) will work on many of the existing 1Billion wireless access points."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/executivesummary.rst:139
msgid "Although the expectation of these pre-existing access points is low in terms of storage and webserver capabilities, they should be enough to serve an on onramp for a web3.0 revolution. In parallel will run single board computers, which will more sufficiently operate the abovementioned webserver software and connect to pre-existing wireless access points. As with Bitcoin, the concept of ISP's, much like banks pre-cryptocurrency, will decentralize e.g. althea.net And centralized webservices e.g. whatsapp, salesforce, meetup, dropbox etc will be succeeded by decentralize, federated, localhost web-services e.g. matrix/element, crm?, odoo, owncloud etc"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/executivesummary.rst:144
msgid "There is popularity with progessive localhost webapps with smart-homes e.g. jellyfin, virtual/ mobilegamepad, openhab etc And with the work-from-home boom post 2020, the fediverse (federated universe) boast some 2million users, with a growing emergence of business applications decentralizing and federating. Returning full circle, the implimentation of fediverse in homes in still a technical process. Hence why DATRO's focus is a universal, fully-autonomous, self-building, webserver for wireless access points/ single board computers connecting to wireless access points."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/executivesummary.rst:149
msgid "The software (entitled HotspotBnB) provides end-users with a friendly user-interface to explore and install web-apps and a friendly local hostname for network access e.g. https://hotspotbnb/ In effect the HotspotBnB search engine on the intial splashpage will display web3.0 applications, which can be installed with 1-click. The more decentralized, federated webapps end-users install locally, the less they'll use web2.0 e.g. Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Twitter etc And with IPFS websites themselves are decentralized too. For this reason IPFS may become part of HotspotBnB during installation. In much the same way we're considering making the virtual touchpad, keyboard and gamepad controller part of HotspotBnB. Since single board computers have HDMI out. Without digressing into detail any further, this is all to say, that this vision of web3.0 is why a protocol such as Bloculus is being thoughtup."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/executivesummary.rst:156
msgid "Bloculus does use Uber's H3 grid reference system which symbolises geographics locations with unique references per each hexagonal in a fractal layered way. But that's not to say each end-user wont obtain a Bloculus H3 reference as a Top Level Domain which corresponds to the physical world location. Security through obscurity is important so the real-world location wont be mandatory. But it will help to have the end-users systems adopt a h3 ref. in a proximity of their location. The reason for this is due to the fact the ISP role is also decentralizing, so the packet routing and speed will be optimum if it can triangulate/ drill down using h3's levels."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/executivesummary.rst:161
msgid "For example Jack is in Scotland and Jill is in London. Jack's message to Jill will get to her by asking each H3 level 1 if Jills H3 level 8 reference is contained within it. The search for Jills reference (as oppose to IP) will search outward from Jack's location in Scotland all the way down to London (not outward over sea, since marine is ignored with Bloculus). And with just a few logical queries at a H3 level 1, a binary 1 will be returned indicating Jills address (h3 level 8 TLD) is part of, say, the 12th H3 level 1 reference queried. Then the routing will query that H3 level 1 reference for all of its level 2 reference until a binary 1 is returned for the H3 level 2 reference containing Jills h3 Level 8 TLD)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/executivesummary.rst:166
msgid "This triangulation feature of the bloculus protocol effectively paints a realtime map of a nationwide mesh network. Since each user's alloted TLD (as oppose to IP address) will have similar domains and subdomains to reflect the locallyhosted decentralized services they're hosting, the federated services can all connect and sync autonomously, including with those on each radio-relay station."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/executivesummary.rst:170
msgid "Futhermore anyone hosting the same federated webservice as Jack and Jill, regardless of if they're a radio-relay between the two friends, effectively help share the load of the overal service, meaning Jack and Jill maybe miles apart, but the service is faster than any centralized service, using DNS and IP etc. And anyone can pull blueprints, build HotspotBnB locally, install decentralized/ federated web-apps, scan and join an Althea mesh network and contribute to and reep the benefits. The concept of Bloculus is secure, decentralized, autonomous, highly compatible and can be made simple to deploy. For the revolutionary implications of such a protocol (Bloculus) and wireless access point operating system (HotspotBnB), the source code itself is public, decentral and under a General Public Licence."
