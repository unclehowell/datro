DATRO Consortium Creditors
================================

Similar to Investors and Developers, the DATRO Consortiums Creditors are scheduled to have loans and interest estinguished fully autonomously by our Decentralized Autonomous Society (DAS).
The latest method employed for this resides with cryptocurrency DOT and the Polkadot blockchain, in which the latest version of this document is regularly and autonomously scraped by a smart contract to determin the lenders, interest and division of funds designated for distribution.
