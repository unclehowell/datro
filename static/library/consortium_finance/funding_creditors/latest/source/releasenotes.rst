The date the file was archived will differ from the date of the document label, which is its creation date.

Version 0.0.5
################

- **2021-05-08** - `In lieu of the fact English is technically my second language (Welsh being my first), I have made corrections to the gramma and spelling in this document which was raised as a concern.`
- **2021-05-08** - `The methodology for archiving the old version was followed with v0.0.3, but the folder 0-0-3 was corrupt and missing the .rst files, could recover from build/HTML but not a feasible exertion of energy, so deleted it instead.`
- **2021-05-08** - `Added initial in the document author segment, since other people exist with the same first/last name. And put space between 'Founder', '@' and 'DATRO' or else web browsers treat it like an email link`
- **2021-05-08** - `The source data seems to have an unwritten methodology for calculating accrued interest on accounts, which doesn't appear to be followed in all cases - unwritten and unautomated being the keyword (action required).`
- **2021-05-08** - `Data had errors that were rectified e.g. some accounts did not have accrued interest added for the years 2021 - and some accounts accrued interest was miscalculated.`

Version 0.0.4
###############

- **2021-05-08** - `Where possible yyyy-mm-dd is used where no date is recorded to maintain formatting consistency in anticipation of Polkadot smart contract scraping.`
- **2021-05-08** - `Creditor data updated since last release (accrued interest, latest deposits etc). Some accounts still require reconciling and new credits exist that are not on record yet.`
- **2021-05-08** - `The content segment was extensive because each creditor had a dedicated entry. Solved this (merged two .rst's and changed header types). Now content segment is brief.`
- **2021-05-06** - `Older version titles ('wave-token-wit' changed to 'datro-creditors') and semantic versions ('0.1.x' changed to '0.0.x') in this release, however archive titles and semantic versions remain unchanged as per archive/"wayback" policy.`
