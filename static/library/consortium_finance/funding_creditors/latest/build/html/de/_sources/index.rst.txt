DATRO Consortium Creditors
================================

The way DATRO expects to autonomously extinguish our lines of credit is similar to the systems we’re putting in place to remunerate our developers and investors. 
Our Consortiums Creditors can expect loans and interest to be extinguished (fully autonomously) by our Decentralized Autonomous Society (DAS) - Which is explained later in this document in more depth. 
The latest method employed for this process, resides within the cryptocurrency DOT and the Polkadot blockchain, in which the latest version of this document is regularly and autonomously scraped by a smart contract to determine the lenders, accrued interest, and then autonomously issue the funds to our lenders cryptocurrency wallets in accordance with the amortization agreements. 
Since this autonomous, decentralized system is still in pre-production, some methodologies are (in the interim) executed manually for purposes of troubleshooting and correct writing of the smart contracts, which can only be amended hereinafter by way of a tokenized vote. 
And until such time as this aspect of our DAS is operational, the accrued interest will compound, but maybe subject to adjustments to ensure the rate and backdate is within the reach of the DAS and its fiscal "burnrate".
