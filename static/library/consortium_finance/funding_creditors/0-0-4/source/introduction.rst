Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike most organisations, DATRO simultaniously operates its own bespoke and internal cryptocurrency banking system and services.
This new trend in tech, business and finance is most commonly refered to as Decentralised Finance (DeFi) and a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO).
This report focuses on Creditors only. To fully understand DeFi and DAO's, readers are advised to research from other sources e.g. Wikipedia
  

DATRO's DAO is also being developed to autonomously maintain these financial reports, updating them each time a block of transaction occcur, in order it remains as consistent as possible to the institutional method of changelogs, reports and document archiving for smoother transition from company to DAO. 
At the time of writing these reports are compiled from source by a system administrator and custom build script, in order to check processes and proceedures before going fully autonomous.
In the event of a new release, our DAO will autonomously archive the source files of the previous version alongside the 'latest' directory e.g. 0-0-1, 0-0-2 etc. And autonomously archive the previously compiled PDF in our wayback archive, then reference the compiled PDF in the releasenotes of the new publication (under the section 'previous versions').  
  

The concept of loans, interest and other such financial instruments surrounding promissory notes isn't new. 
But our DAO method is s prefered way of automating the administration, transactions and record-keeping of this business area.
Our DAO is also sometimes refered to as a DAS (Decentralised, Autonomous Society) due to the magnitude of the stakeholders involved, which constitute the organisation being a stand-alone society and not just a typical organisation.
