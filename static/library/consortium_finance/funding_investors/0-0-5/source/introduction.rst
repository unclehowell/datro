Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DATRO Consortium features a portfolio of technologies, designed to free, decentralize and democratize our ability to communicate digitally.
This document mainly relates to one of these technologies: a series of cryptocurrency smart contracts known as a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO).
Since the number of stakeholders now exeed the minimum requirement, its nomenclature is actually that of a Decentralised Autonomous Society (DAS).
This digital assets full title is the 'Scottish Bay DAS' - named after the Caribbean location where it was first developed in 2017.

1. Royalties generated from our network autonomously pool into the escrow wallet address of a top level smart contract.
2. This top level smart contract autonomously divides funds between 3 second level smart contracts e.g. wave-users, financeers & developers.
3. The cryptocurrency token representing eligability to royalties in the network, also permits the token holder to vote on changes to the smart contracts. 

For example, John owns 10% of the network and he transfers half his holding to his ex-wife.
Henceforth, 10% of the royalties generated from the DATRO Network, split evenly between John and his ex-wife.
There's no paperwork, registration, photo ID identification, lawyers or banks etc. 

Our DAS smart contracts lookup the wallet addresses where the ownership tokens are held before issuing the royalties.
