**Introduction**

This publication details the DATRO Consortiums (1) Master shareholders register, (2) Base-interest rates (Accurals & Compounding) and (3) Investment Activity (Summary & Detailed 'Mini-Statements')

This report is produced semi-autonomously as part of the DATRO Consortiums transition from web-2.0 to web-3.0.
In web 2.0 the shareholders register and investment activities would be compiled centrally and manually and submitted to a pre-existing societies, pre-existing framework e.g. .gov TLD, central bank etc.
With web 3.0 the DATRO Consortium is able to operate as a cryptocurrency/ blockchain-based, Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO). Or further still a DAS (D.A Society) 
e.g. fully decentralized with full annonymity and "smart contract" autonomy (self-administering/ governing ("liquid democracy" tokenized voting)).
