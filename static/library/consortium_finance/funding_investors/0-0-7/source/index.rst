============================

This publication reports the latest data corresponding to the DATRO Consortium's investment accounts and the Annual Rate of Interest (APR) accumulated on all deposits made by investors.
This document also introduces readers to the innovative methodology DATRO adopts for managing investment accounts. A methodology which, in every way imaginable, outperform the traditional/ institutional approaches e.g. shares in a company and/or quarterly/ annually dividends (via fiat currency and banks) etc

The DATRO Consortium is, by design, able to operate fully autonomously, with full annonymity and without a central point of control. 
For this reason a blockchain and cryptocurrency is used to manage ownership of the consortium, voting rights and distribution of royalties and interest to the consortiums various groups of beneficiaries - especially and including DATRO's investors.
