## Introduction

The `_theme-wiki` is a bash script designed to do the following:

1. convert our wikipedias .md files to .rst
2. make pre-publish error corrections autonomously
3. publish as html and pdf like any other document in the library

This way the entire Wikipedia can be downloaded as a single PDF or viewed as a html document in a theme consistent with the GUI or Websites 

The wiki origionates on github, but it can be pulled locally and viewed/edited as html on the localhost using apt package: gollum 
Although the wiki can be added as a subrepo, it's not imortalised in our view unless it's in RST
