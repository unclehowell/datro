msgid "In anticipation of our solution, we are building a network of communication equipment rooms on the north east coast of a Caribbean island. The 70km coastline is entitled the Scottish Bay. Here we will showcase the worlds first free internet network. The equipment rooms are built on private property and have plenty of space inside to facilitate the needs of the custodian in addition to our commercial requirements. For example, the resident has a energy and communication solution, helping to reduce their monthly utility bills and preserve the lifespan of their equipment. This same equipment room serves as a radio relay station for our larger communications network spanning the entire 70km \"Scottish Bay\" Caribbean coastline. This approach also permits web 3.0 services to be deployed to the region, enhancing both the residential custodians experience and the wider networks/ end-users quality of service. The communications rooms (codenamed Neo Domes) save custodians in the region of $10k during their lifespan of 25+ years, while simultaniously netting a profit of $10k+ for our consortium each month."

msgid "Production of the equipment rooms is streamlined but requires security, living quarters, specialist materials and tools, health and safety equipment and so forth. For this reason a dedicated campus is a basic requirement for the operation. In 2014 our first campus was launched, attracting the likes of high profile developers such as DD-WRT, Germany. In 2015 we built our own dedicated campus on the northern most point of the Scottish Bay, but the project was shortlived since the land purchased was in dispute with other owners. So in 2016 we moved to a new site in the center of the Scottish Bay, where we built our first showcase neo-dome and secured a patent deal and a \"loon\" contract with Google. DATRO has been largely itinerant since 2019 as the focus moved to the internet and the underlying software powering the wireless access points and equipment rooms. In 2021 the opportunity to have a dedicated campus/ facility where equipment room production can resume, is once again being explored."

msgid "Many in this field have tried and failed since we first presented our idea of free internet access (and internet as a human right) to the United Nations Telecommunications Union (in Dubai in 2012). This is a marathon not a sprint. While profit is important for sustainability, the cause itself has to be treated as a non-profit too so that the effort continues regardless of funding. It is after all a humanitarian effort. Competitiveness is something that has come and gone over the years. The fact remains that access to the internet is still not free and the whole world is still not fully connected. Until such time competitiveness is incosequential - this is a challenge like sword in the stone. Many have tried and failed. DATRO is an underdog in this race. We are careful to pace ourselves for the longhall - approaching this challenge too aggressively is what we have seen competitors do, depleating lots of funds without gaining the desired results. DATRO will have invested in the region of $1M between 2012 and 2022 and our collection of software tools and intellectual property remains one of the most plausible in the world in terms of achieving delivering a legal and lawful free internet solution."
