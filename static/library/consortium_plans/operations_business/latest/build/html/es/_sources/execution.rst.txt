Marketing & Sales
==================

Sales and Marking is still some time away due to the research and development still being undertaken. 
However the entire project can be explored via our website: https://datro.world 

Marketing Plan
---------------

Once we are satisfied with any of the technologies in our portfolio, we will take them to market. We anticipate this to be around 2025.
In the interim we invite any member of the public to try our beta software in the hopes developers out there will participate in our charter.  

Sales Plan
-----------

In anticipation of our solution, we are building a network of communication equipment rooms on the north east coast of a Caribbean island. 
The 70km coastline is entitled the Scottish Bay. Here we will showcase the worlds first free internet network. 
The equipment rooms are built on private property and have plenty of space inside to facilitate the needs of the custodian in addition to our commercial requirements.
For example, the resident has a energy and communication solution, helping to reduce their monthly utility bills and preserve the lifespan of their equipment.
This same equipment room serves as a radio relay station for our larger communications network spanning the entire 70km "Scottish Bay" Caribbean coastline.
This approach also permits web 3.0 services to be deployed to the region, enhancing both the residential custodians experience and the wider networks/ end-users quality of service.
The communications rooms (codenamed Neo Domes) save custodians in the region of $10k during their lifespan of 25+ years, while simultaniously netting a profit of $10k+ for our consortium each month.     
 

Operations
===========

Production of the equipment rooms is streamlined but requires security, living quarters, specialist materials and tools, health and safety equipment and so forth.
For this reason a dedicated campus is a basic requirement for the operation. In 2014 our first campus was launched, attracting the likes of high profile developers such as DD-WRT, Germany.
In 2015 we built our own dedicated campus on the northern most point of the Scottish Bay, but the project was shortlived since the land purchased was in dispute with other owners. 
So in 2016 we moved to a new site in the center of the Scottish Bay, where we built our first showcase neo-dome and secured a patent deal and a "loon" contract with Google. 
DATRO has been largely itinerant since 2019 as the focus moved to the internet and the underlying software powering the wireless access points and equipment rooms.      
In 2021 the opportunity to have a dedicated campus/ facility where equipment room production can resume, is once again being explored. 

Locations & Facilities
-----------------------

Scottish Bay, DR. 
Workshop, Security, Accomodation, Transport, Infrastructure, Training facility, Media Room (for producing/editing on-site training/marketing material etc) etc. 


Technology
-----------

Cacher - A solution to simulate internet where there is none for purposes of tricking our automated software into building itself.
To-Go  - A persistent-live USB ("workstation on a stick"). A complete operating system with all the software required to manage the network, pre-installed and configured.
HBnB   - Rapid deployment of applications to wireless access points and equipment rooms. Run on small, single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi. 
Repo   - Short for Repository - A 'monorepo' (single repository) containing all of the resources for operation e.g. documents, software source-code, training videos, websites etc -     
Wave   - The software solution for automating the collection of revenue from the network (dedicated to end-users, not beneficiaries) and autonomously remunerating gatekeepers for the traffic to the network.  
DAS    - Like a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation e.g. a hierarchy of cryptocurrency smart contracts, but with as many stakeholders as the minimum of that of a society e.g. 50,000+
       - We call this Decentralised Autonomous Society the Scottish Bay Society - It will include web3.0 services for members e.g. tenancy deposit schemes, bail bonds, insurances etc
Docs   - Document Library - In RestructuredText/Markdown for easy transportability and compiling to PDF and HTML e.g. https://library.datro.world


Equipment & Tools
------------------

Additional Equipment and Tools will be required subject to the terrain of the campus/facility of the operation. 


Milestones & Metrics
======================

1. Establish Order - Routines, Schedules, Plans, Measures, Goals etc
2. Prep - Pre Operating Preperation e.g. safety checks, roll calls, coverage-map, suppliers, methodologies (admin, project management etc), inventory/stock control etc
3. Begin Operations - Best practices, nock-on's, de-briefs, first works on vehicles, team building excercises, accounting, general command & leadership etc
4. Sustainability - Health and Safety, Career prospects, Recruiting, Management Reporting, Supply Chain, Maintenance Schedules, Compliance, Community Relations etc
5. Exit - Sale (of campus and network e.g. access easements etc/ Downscale/ Upscale/ lateral move (re-locate)/ shutdown (bankrupcy/ cease & disist etc) 

Milestones Table
