The internet is great, but accessing the internet remains an affordable privilege, courtesy of autocratic and centralized service providers.
The DATRO Consortium is attempting to decentralize, democratize and free access to the internet.

DATRO itself is a consortium of free, publicly available, democratic and decentralized technologies designed to enable anyone, anywhere to access the internet for free and as a human right.
The primary technology being researched and developed is a free and universal software upgrade, for the worlds 1,000,000,000+ wireless access points. 
DATRO's focus is a single 60Mb file, which can be uploaded to any wi-fi router via its backup/restore feature. 

For residential and small business users, DATRO offers a universal, free software upgrade (Compatible on 20M+ wireless routers worldwide as of 2021).
For non-compatible routers our software can be run on a seperate, low-cost (wirelessly-connected) IoT device e.g. Raspberry Pi (30M+ in circulation worldwide as of 2021).


Opportunity
============


Problem Summary
-----------------

While internet itself is (questionably) open and transparent and free, access to the internet remains in the hands of centralised, undemocratic, monopolies.
  

Solution Summary
-----------------

It is now technologically possible for anyone, anywhere to setup access to the internet for themselves and their community and pay less (perhaps even $0, perhaps even earn $$$) and with a fully transparent and open(public) solution
A bridge is being created between the technology and practices of skilled internet service engineers and competent members of the general public. 

This software upgrade (targeting 5% of global wireless access points in year 1) is free, fully-autonomous and can be obtained with full-anonymity (no credentials required).
The first notable difference after the software upgrade is a new wireless router dashboard menu, featuring the worlds first wi-fi router app store.
We believe installing web-applications to your wireless access point is integral to making access to the internet free, democratic and decentralised.

An example Decentralized App (DApp) is Althea. A California-based startup, whos software application allow you to mesh your wireless access point with your neighbours and share costs using cryptocurrency.
We also incorporated JSECoin. A Cambridge(UK) based startup, whos technology allows you to mine cryptocurrency while accessing web-applications on your wireless access point.
And with the addition of our own DApp called Wave, users can autonomously re-route revenue from JSECoin to Althea resulting in a subsidised, perhaps even free internet connection.

There is no advertising in this model. Instead the reduntant processing power of the wireless devices connected to your newly upgraded wireless access point, is used to perform blockchain functions.
The remuneration for these functions are intravenously credited to your wireless access point for the data being consumed e.g. free internet
For non-residential/small business e.g. military, educational institutions etc DATRO is currently trialling a geodesic communications equipment room solution.

Market Summary
---------------

Access to the internet has been flatlining for years since the growth of the network is heavily dependant on a billing model whereby the end-user pays. 
For a % of the global population the cost per GB of data is still too expensive. However the value of connecting this demographic to the internet, is strong for those already connected e.g. preserving dying languages etc 
The solution proposed by DATRO hits a cross section of many markets, more than four of which are in the tens and hundreds of billions each year e.g. IoT, Web 3.0, voice/data communications, blockchain/cryptocurrencies etc

**By DATRO's calculations it's possible to profit from connecting people to the internet for free** and without ads or data mining etc
This is due to the following fact:

1. The margin between **(1) revenue discounting end-users internet** and **(2) data consumption costs** continues to shrink 
2. The margin decrease is on trajectory to hitting a cruciendo whereby (1) cancels out (2) ... resulting in free access to internet for end-users.
3. And like Metcalfs, Gildafs and Moors laws, there's no foreseeable reason why these trends should cease to continue.

Therefore the decreasing margin between **(1) the revenue generated from the correctly designed internet service** and **(2) the data consumption cost of said service** will surpass a cruciendo whereby one cancels out the other, resulting in an ever increasing margin between the two e.g. revenue and eventual ROI/profits.

 
 
is a margin which is expected to grow as the trend grows. 
So in 2020 - 2025 we will see monetisation of the network paying for the network. Then in 2025 - 2030 we will see an abudance of revenue being generated as the data consumption cost reduces and the monetisation methods are optimised and become more efficient e.g. profit opportunity (web 3.0 will help in this area)  

Competition
------------

Many in this field have tried and failed since we first presented our idea of free internet access (and internet as a human right) to the United Nations Telecommunications Union (in Dubai in 2012).
This is a marathon not a sprint. While profit is important for sustainability, the cause itself has to be treated as a non-profit too so that the effort continues regardless of funding. It is after all a humanitarian effort.
Competitiveness is something that has come and gone over the years. The fact remains that access to the internet is still not free and the whole world is still not fully connected. Until such time competitiveness is incosequential - this is a challenge like sword in the stone. Many have tried and failed. 
DATRO is an underdog in this race. We are careful to pace ourselves for the longhall - approaching this challenge too aggressively is what we have seen competitors do, depleating lots of funds without gaining the desired results. 
DATRO will have invested in the region of $1M between 2012 and 2022 and our collection of software tools and intellectual property remains one of the most plausible in the world in terms of achieving delivering a legal and lawful free internet solution. 

Overview
---------

Our hope is that the desire to receive internet for free is motivation enough for someone, somewhere to adopt our solutions. 
We expect the result to be so satisfactory for the end-user that they, by their own accord, help drive our solution into their communities.
Providing our solution is free, simple and well documented/ presented, we expect social media to do what it does as far as spreading our message.
There are phases to the ambition of our project:
 - Owners of the 50Million+ single board computers out there, to be early adopters and at least try our software and provide us feedback so we can improve it for public release.
 - Sustained usage of our solution - not just testing and feedback, but end-users that depend on our solution for sustained free internet access
 - Heards - Not just individual geeks and freaks, but a family or a community facility e.g. business, school, uni etc - depending on our solution for low-cost/free internet connectivity.    
 - Fanatics - People who are so in love with our solution they do their upmost to promote and share and facility others with our solution 

Why Us
-------

I am Sion. The Founder and CEO. I have been in communications and IT since I was 14, I am now 37 (at the time of writing this). 
My experience and training in various technologies is beyond a hobby - I was a cyber & electronic warfare engineer in the british armed forces for 5 years and have been a tech entreprenuer since 2007.
I have built a large network of people with the skills and experience to help me make this vision for free internet access a reality. 
Over the years my commitment has withstood the test of time and this project is being recognised for its store of value (viability for investment) and its future potential as a large-scale international employer of people, regardless of a myriad of socio-economic conditions (for example, we survived the 2020 global pandemic while many organisations went under forever). 


Expectations
==============

1. A community is already growing around this technology product/ service, allowing DATRO to prove the revenue potential and attention retained by the technology. 
2. A small network grows which is able to sustain a regions communications while others fail e.g. earthquakes, cyber attacks etc - demonstrating our technical supremacy 
3. Traction and growth becomes more frictionless - we see networks springing up around the world, without our knowledge or participation - just people using the material and software we've published to gain for themselves what we have
4. Revolution - large scale adoption, abandonment of the traditional ISP and billing model worldwide

Forecast
---------

1. 2020 - 2025
2. 2025 - 2030
3. 2030 - 2035
4. 2035 - 2040

Financial Highlights by Year
-----------------------------

1. 2025 - $100M Revenue per annum (50% back to end-users, 50% shared between financeers and developers)
2. 2035 - $1B revenue per annum (why not. $2.5 per month per end-users. 1 Billion wireless access points in the world as of 2020 and growing)

Subsequently we would like to see the following (for the sake of simplicity): 

2026 = $100M, 2027 = $200M, 2028 = $300M, 2029 = $400M, 2030 = $500M, 2031 = $600M, 2032 = $700M, 2033 = $800M, 2034 = $900M, 2035 = $1Billion

Financing Needed
-----------------

2012 - 2020 = $1M seed funding (achieved) 
2020+ = $7.7M startup (sale of 15% equity)

Possibly a Series A - Subject to earnings.
