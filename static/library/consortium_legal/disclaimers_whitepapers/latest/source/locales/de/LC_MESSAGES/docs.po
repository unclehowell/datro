#~ "In anticipation of our solution, we "

#~ "70km coastline is entitled the Scottish"
#~ " Bay. Here we will showcase the "
#~ "worlds first free internet network. The"
#~ " equipment rooms are built on private"
#~ " property and have plenty of space"
#~ " inside to facilitate the needs of"
#~ " the custodian in addition to our "
#~ "commercial requirements. For example, the "
#~ "resident has a energy and communication"

#~ "same equipment room serves as a "

#~ "communications network spanning the entire "
#~ "70km \"Scottish Bay\" Caribbean coastline. "
#~ "This approach also permits web 3.0 "
#~ "services to be deployed to the "

#~ "the operation. In 2014 our first "
#~ "campus was launched, attracting the "
#~ "likes of high profile developers such"

#~ " built our own dedicated campus on"
#~ " the northern most point of the "
#~ "Scottish Bay, but the project was "
#~ "shortlived since the land purchased was"
#~ " in dispute with other owners. So "
#~ "in 2016 we moved to a new "
#~ "site in the center of the Scottish"
#~ " Bay, where we built our first "
#~ "showcase neo-dome and secured a "
