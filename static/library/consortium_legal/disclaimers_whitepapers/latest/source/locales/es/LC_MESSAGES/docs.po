"In anticipation of our solution, we are building a network of "
"communication equipment rooms on the north east coast of a Caribbean "
"island. The 70km coastline is entitled the Scottish Bay. Here we will "
"showcase the worlds first free internet network. The equipment rooms are "
"built on private property and have plenty of space inside to facilitate "
"the needs of the custodian in addition to our commercial requirements. "
"For example, the resident has a energy and communication solution, "
"helping to reduce their monthly utility bills and preserve the lifespan "
"of their equipment. This same equipment room serves as a radio relay "
"station for our larger communications network spanning the entire 70km "
"\"Scottish Bay\" Caribbean coastline. This approach also permits web 3.0 "
"services to be deployed to the region, enhancing both the residential "
"custodians experience and the wider networks/ end-users quality of "
"service. The communications rooms (codenamed Neo Domes) save custodians "
"in the region of $10k during their lifespan of 25+ years, while "
"simultaniously netting a profit of $10k+ for our consortium each month."

"Production of the equipment rooms is streamlined but requires security, "
"living quarters, specialist materials and tools, health and safety "
"equipment and so forth. For this reason a dedicated campus is a basic "
"requirement for the operation. In 2014 our first campus was launched, "
"attracting the likes of high profile developers such as DD-WRT, Germany. "
"In 2015 we built our own dedicated campus on the northern most point of "
"the Scottish Bay, but the project was shortlived since the land purchased"
" was in dispute with other owners. So in 2016 we moved to a new site in "
"the center of the Scottish Bay, where we built our first showcase neo-"
"dome and secured a patent deal and a \"loon\" contract with Google. DATRO"
" has been largely itinerant since 2019 as the focus moved to the internet"
" and the underlying software powering the wireless access points and "
"equipment rooms. In 2021 the opportunity to have a dedicated campus/ "
"facility where equipment room production can resume, is once again being "
"explored."

"Many in this field have tried and failed since we first presented our "

"United Nations Telecommunications Union (in Dubai in 2012). This is a "
"marathon not a sprint. While profit is important for sustainability, the "
"cause itself has to be treated as a non-profit too so that the effort "
"continues regardless of funding. It is after all a humanitarian effort. "
"Competitiveness is something that has come and gone over the years. The "
"fact remains that access to the internet is still not free and the whole "
"world is still not fully connected. Until such time competitiveness is "
"incosequential - this is a challenge like sword in the stone. Many have "
"tried and failed. DATRO is an underdog in this race. We are careful to "
"pace ourselves for the longhall - approaching this challenge too "
"aggressively is what we have seen competitors do, depleating lots of "
"funds without gaining the desired results. DATRO will have invested in "
"the region of $1M between 2012 and 2022 and our collection of software "
