Upgrading
============

The term 'Upgrade' is a term reserved for an alteration made to the software build itself, in which case an increase to the second but last digit is made to reflect this e.g. ``0.X.0``.  An Upgrade will more than likely require the user to re-download and install the software. The exception to this rule is in the case of major updates which can change the user experience so dramatically we mark the occaSi√¥n by changing the second but one digit of the version (as we do in the case of upgrades e.g. ``0.X.0``)
