msgid "Remember, openHAB is just a computer program. The computer will only do what *you* tell it to do. openHAB can provide many default solutions that are easy to setup. On the flip side, the more you insist that everything should look and work exactly the way you want it, the more work you will have to invest. openHAB is fully customizable, but doing so will require substantial effort on your part."

msgid "While openHABian offers a streamlined and simplified way to get up and running quickly, it is a complete openHAB home automation system easily capable of automating your entire home. It is worth noting two potential limitations of Raspberry Pis, however: RPi 3 and older are limited in RAM (1 GB of memory or less) and may not perform well when additional memory hungry applications such as databases and data visualization programs are being used. Two or more GB should be fine. Running Raspberries off the internal SD card only may result in system instabilities as these memory cards can degrade quickly under openHAB’s use conditions (infamous ‘wearout’). When you choose to deploy openHABian, there’s the ZRAM feature available to mitigate."
