What is Hotspotβnβ?
-----------------

The Hotspotβnβ Operating System (Hotspotβnβ) is a Free & Open-Source Linux-Based Software, designed to make any Single Board Computer a Plug & Play **Smart Smart Home Hotspot** with the unique capability of making internet Freer and/or completely free for the household in which it operates. The solution also features some great open source and free apps for the end-users e.g. IPTV/ Media Center, IPCCTV DVR, IoT Smart Home Control, Vehicle Tracking and Energy Monitoring - All autonomously installed and configured during initial installation, which is also autonomous. Hotspotβnβ simply copies onto a Micro SD card, inserts into any Single Board Computer connected to the internet and within minutes can be used, enjoyed and benefitted from.

Keep in mind that although I am a professional engineer with extensive background experience and education, this is the first product of this magnitude I have attempted to develop, the work is ongoing and as of 2018 I am still in the early phases and some time away from a final solution. There is much I have yet to learnt about best practices for Documenting, Open Source Code & version Control and Systems Integration of the various technologies included in this new Operating System. There are industry standard methodologies this new Operating System is yet to adhear to - I remain humble and open to suggestions at all levels. 

Everything you find here at this stage is without waranty and I accept not responsible for any inconveniences or issues that might occur as a result of use of this new Operating System: Hotspotβnβ. As time goes on I can only assure you that less Single Board Computers and Memory Sticks become damaged and/or 'bricked' by Hotspotβnβ. Fortunately both are low cost hardware and Hotspotβnβ is free, so it's feasible fun and promising technology right now, to say the least. 

Languages

The primary language of Hotspotβnβ will be English. Secondary languages will be introduced using translators which will use the English literature as the primary source of information.
