This segment serves two different purposes, depending on the role of the reader.
For project managers(PM's) this is effectively a highlight report. For developers(Dev's) it's a changelog. Content includes:
 - a summary of what's new or changed since the last release e.g. performance report(PM's), dependancy & compatibility consideration (Dev's)
 - links to older/archived releases of this document e.g. points of reference for PM's 'plans v performance' / Change log for Dev's
 - issues, risks and concers, ideas etc ... e.g. for inclusion in any plans moving forward/ re-releases
 - notes on future re-releases e.g. plans moving forward
