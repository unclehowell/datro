Background
==============

Operation Tech Saxon recognizes that network telecom infrastructures have become reliable and wide spread enough to depend societies future upon. Perhaps even more so than the archaic solutions we still depend on today e.g. institutions, the monetary system and law.

There are now clear opportunities to transpose network telecoms infrastructure from a subsidiary of these social systems and into a prosperous free resource, upon which our social systems can re-establish themselves on.

For over a decade web-based services have proven Metcalf's technology theory by scaling their networks exponentially while their services remain free to the users. This is due to their advertising model which gives service providers a better incentive than a user based billing model.

So why has the network telecom infrastructures not moved to an ad-supported model yet? Surely this would guarantee world interconnectivity.
 
It's because the technology required to develop an advertising supported, free digital communications network did not exist, until now.
