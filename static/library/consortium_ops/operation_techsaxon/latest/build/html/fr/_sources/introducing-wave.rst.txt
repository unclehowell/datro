Introducing Wave
================================================

R&D successes have now enabled the development of the worlds first network telecom advertising platform, which is due for launch in 2013 under the brand: WAVE. 

Voted for the 2012 Cisco British Innovation Award and 2013 Mobile Global Award, WAVE superimposes interactive display ads onto the users web browsing experience and replaces call progress tones with audio ads, resulting in monetized voice and data traffic. 

This is achieved by way of a simple firmware upgrade on the infrastructures networking and telephone exchange hardware. WAVE also provides advertisers with a self-service campaign portal which serves as a comparable alternative to radio and online advertising.

Since funding for the network can now run in parallel to service adoption, the incentive to scale the network will change, causing it to grow exponentially. This solution breaks down service adoption barriers and guarantees digital communication for the unconnected.
