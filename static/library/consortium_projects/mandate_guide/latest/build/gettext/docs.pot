Clear definition of what is expected from project contractors. Concise expectations to be met throughout the entire duration of the project. Clients Quality expectation is detailed in this section and has been explained as clearly as possible so that the project team includes these expectations in the quality control phase of the project. This segment is designed to ensure that all work meets the quality expectation as well as the objectives before it can be expected to be approved and/or delivered to the Client. This is by far the most important section of this entire document and tenders should insist on its revision, as with any part of this mandate, if Client's Expectation of the final deliverable is unclear or vague, because leniency, patience and understanding at the deadline delivery date may not be afforded by the Client, to those whom are contracted to undertake this project. Throughout the course of the project, whereby the Client is the project board and authority, it becomes the obligation of the successful tenderer(s) to insist the Client and/or the project board and authority, update this mandate to include missing quality expectation information in a sufficient time frame before the deadline delivery date, since the Client cannot be expected, at this juncture, to know everything to expect from the solutions presented after this documents publication."
