</section>
<section id="constraints">
<h2>Constraints<a class="headerlink" href="#constraints" title="Enlazar permanentemente con este título"></a></h2>
<p>Known constraints help clarify the reality of the surrounding environment of the Client, successful tenderer and the project team and their combined resources in order to successfully achieve the goals and objectives, by ensuring no limiting factors are left out of the equation.
Constraints to consider can be anything from financial, politicalor, psychopolitical, environmental, technical, legal, commercial etc.
In all cases known constraints should surface into this document as later exposure to constraints may have serious implications that can affect the project goals and objectives and subsequent deliverables.
Ultimately the more information and more refined the definitions earlier in the project pre-planning, the more chance of success exists in the final solution meeting and even exceeding the clients original expectations, as expressed in this mandate.</p>

<section id="interfaces">
<h2>Interfaces<a class="headerlink" href="#interfaces" title="Enlazar permanentemente con este título"></a></h2>

This segment is designed to ensure that all work meets the quality expectation as well as the objectives before it can be expected to be approved and/or delivered to the Client. This is by far the most important section of this entire document and tenders should insist on its revision, as with any part of this mandate, if Client’s Expectation of the final deliverable is unclear or vague, because leniency, patience and understanding at the deadline delivery date may not be afforded by the Client, to those whom are contracted to undertake this project. Throughout the course of the project, whereby the Client is the project board and authority, it becomes the obligation of the successful tenderer(s) to insist the Client and/or the project board and authority, update this mandate to include missing quality expectation information in a sufficient time frame before the deadline delivery date, since the Client cannot be expected, at this juncture, to know everything to expect from the solutions presented after this documents publication.</p>
