Imaging for a second we could all perform a simple and free software upgrade on our wireless access points - resulting in them becoming as simple to manage and as powerful as our smartphones? Here at DATR<span class="copy-left">&#xa9;</span> we are working in collaboration with tens of thousands of developers to research and develop this technology and opportunity, since we believe it's the key to decentralizing, democratizing (and making access to) the internet, 100% free.</p>

<h1 class="segment-title" style="color:rgba(255,255,255,0.9)!important;">User Experience</h1>


<p class="segment-paragraph" style="text-align:center; color:rgba(255,255,255,0.9)!important;">John and his neighbour Malcom are middle aged, they're not technical in any way, but they can operate a smartphone. Both decide to try our free software solution. So they run our automated software upgrade on their wireless access points. Within 30 minutes the upgrade is complete and they're in disbelief about how easy the automated upgrade process was. Now, when then go to access their old wireless router menu's, they're presented with a stylish new and modern web app, featuring a built-in app-store. This allows them both to explore and install all of the latest wi-fi hotspot applications, directly onto their wireless routers.</p>

<p class="segment-paragraph" style="text-align:center; color:rgba(255,255,255,0.9)!important;">One app they decide to try allows their two wireless access points to communicate directly with each other, without dissrupting their existing internet connection or wi-fi station broadcast. Some other web-apps they install even allow them to game and monitor their energy/ ip cameras AND control their smart homes (all without depending on an active internet connection). John and his neighbour also install Decentralized Applications (DApps) to their mobile devices, allowing to communicate and transact cryptocurrency with each other, over the internet and/or directly over their new mesh/p2p network.</p>

<p class="segment-paragraph" style="text-align:center; color:rgba(255,255,255,0.9)!important;">The following week a storm (or cyber attack) causes their towns internet to go down for an entire month. As their region decends into chaos, John and Malcom continue to digitally transact and communicate with each other and monitor their ip cameras/ energy AND control their smart homes without any dissruptions. Even while John's over Malcoms house sharing a pot of coffee, John can remotely monitor and control his own home, remotely, over their mesh/p2p network.</p>

<h1 class="segment-title" style="color:rgba(255,255,255,0.9)!important;">Developer Experience</h1>

<p class="segment-paragraph" style="text-align:center; color:rgba(255,255,255,0.9)!important;">Nichola is a web developer and linux software programmer. She's been a user of DATR<span class="copy-left">&#xa9;</span>'s technology for a few months and has some ideas of how to improve it and the skills to materialise her ideas for the platform. So Nichola visits our online Academy and completes the course for web & software developers, giving her a deeper understanding of DATR<span class="copy-left">&#xa9;</span>'s network and platform, enough to give her the confidence she needs to actively participate in imporoving our open-source code.</p>

<p class="segment-paragraph" style="text-align:center; color:rgba(255,255,255,0.9)!important;">By following the videos and technical documents from the Academy training course, Nichola is able to successfully write her idea into a bit of script and save it in her own public source-code reposity, along with her cryptocurrency wallet addresses for receiving payment for her contribution. Nichola then "checks-out" the DATR<span class="copy-left">&#xa9;</span>'s source-code from our public MonoREAPo and modifies it to include her script (as a "sub-repo"). She also modifies our open-source code to use the script is proposing. Then Nichola performs a pull request, so that our development-branch moderators can see her request/proposal, to change DATR<span class="copy-left">&#xa9;</span>'s source code. Our team love her suggestions, so we accept the proposed changes, we then merge our development branch into our master branch and her changes become part of our next software release. And we deposit cryptocurrency royalty tokens into Nicholas cryptocurrency wallets.</p>

<p class="segment-paragraph" style="text-align:center; color:rgba(255,255,255,0.9)!important;">Nichola is proud of the changes she made, which not only improved her user experience, but the user experience for all the other users on the DATR<span class="copy-left">&#xa9;</span> network. Furthermore Nicholas is beginning to receive a frequent deposit of cryptocurrency into her wallet addresses. DATR<span class="copy-left">&#xa9;</span>'s network will pay Nichola these royalties for her valuable contribution, for the lifespan of our technology platform or for as long it's dependant on the code she contributed.</p>

<h1 class="segment-title" style="color:rgba(255,255,255,0.9)!important;">How DATR<span class="copy-left">&#xa9;</span>&nbsp;Works</h1>

<p class="segment-paragraph" style="text-align:center; color:rgba(255,255,255,0.9)!important;">The DATR<span class="copy-left">&#xa9;</span> Network and Platform is fully decentralizing and autonomousizing including self-financing and self-governing systems e.g. liquid democracy. And the entire platform will function with full anonymity e.g. no identiy required from developers, users, investors etc. Here's a brief breakdown of the DATR<span class="copy-left">&#xa9;</span> business model:</p>

<p class="segment-paragraph" style="text-align:center; color:rgba(255,255,255,0.9)!important;">1. Since the user access our platforms web-apps via their web browsers, it puts us in a unique position to mine cryptocurrency using the redundant processing power of every mobile device connected to our network. This is an opt-in feature that the user can chose weather or not to participate in.</p>

<p class="segment-paragraph" style="text-align:center; color:rgba(255,255,255,0.9)!important;">2. Then a series of smart contracts autonomously distribute this revenue, equally, to all of the cryptocurrency wallet addresses in all of the repositories of all of the software dependancies in our platforms source-code.</p>

<p class="segment-paragraph" style="text-align:center; color:rgba(255,255,255,0.9)!important;">3. If a stakeholder such as an investor or developer, decides to share their royalty token with someone else and transfers 50% of it to the other individual, they will autonomously receive 50% of the networks royalties, alloted to that specific token. these tokens also permit the stakeholder to raise (and vote on) issues.</p>

<p class="segment-paragraph" style="text-align:center; color:rgba(255,255,255,0.9)!important;">4. Everything including the websites, software, technical documents, dependancies and even the training videos and material and tools to produce the material, is all contained within one very large source-code repository known as the monorepo. Which is fully transparent and public for anyone to inspect. transactions are also all done on the cryptocurrency blockchains, which means they're also public and transparent for anyone to see.</p>

<p class="segment-paragraph" style="text-align:center; color:rgba(255,255,255,0.9)!important;">5. While the code curently exists in a central Github repo, we are migrating the repo itself to the blockchain too. This means that anyone wanting to modify the source code will need to raise the proposed changes as a matter to be voted on. This allows all of the stakeholders to place a vote on weather or not to accept or reject the proposed changes. Which is more democratized than having select moderators approve/ reject proposed changes to the source-code, which may not be so democratic. We expect a lot of activity in the early years of building this network, so we'll continue to use Github. But once the software, service and network has been built and the developmment activity is less periodic, the source code can be moved to the blockchain and liquid democracy can come into full force and effect </p>
