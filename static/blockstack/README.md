# DATRO Consortium: BlockStack

BlockStack, formerly "evr-network" testnet, is a modular solution for using excess energy to perform blockchain functions.  
Whereas the local energy supplier would provide, say $0.11 per Kwh to buy back energy, BlockStack is expected to be double.   
The initial investment and ROI is also expected to be more appealing:
Instead of paying $1k for a bi-directional meter to be installed by an electrician, you simply plug in any number of $100 BlockStacks   
Each BlockStack then gives twice the return on investment for each Kwh used.  

BlockStacks communicate with your energy solution to ensure only excess solar energy is consumed   
They communicate with your solar inverter over wi-fi, in order to operate on low energy/ standby when there's no surplus energy  
When surplus energy exists the devices run at maximum capacity, increasing the load to maximise revenue generation by performing blockchain function   
For best results BlockStacks should be run in swarms or clusters of between 10 and 50 per household.
