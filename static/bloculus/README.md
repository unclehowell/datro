# DATRO Consortium: Bloculus

Bloculus is a new protocol being developed for the trial DATRO Web3.0 Mesh Network on the Scottish Bay, DR.  
At the time of writing this, we're using Ubers H3 Hexagon/Honeycomb grid, overlayed onto an OpenMap of the María Trinidad Sánchez and Samana Province e.g. Scottish Bay   
Each honeycomb grid reference will be registed as a Top Level Domain to create exclusive virtual real estate which can be regulated e.g. owned and controlled.   
We anticiplate the h3 "resolution" to be a honeycomb (circa) every 50 meters.  
Each Geodesic communications equipment room (Neo Dome) will utalize the H3-TLD within its proximity to automate mesh network handshakes and links between each web3.0 service/node running from the location e.g.  messaging.h3reflocation1 , ipfs.h3reflocation2 etc   
With the Top Level Domain and Domain name taken care of, we now add the specific service as a subdomain e.g. matrix.messaging.h3ref , filecoin.ipfs.h3ref etc  

The Bloculus protocol gives each Neo Dome on the network the capability to continuously seek other Neo Domes within its proximity, and mesh network to them, in the most efficient way possible; scanning in ever-increasing circles of the honeycombs surrounding it  
Once the mesh aspect has established communications with its neighbouring Neo Dome(s), the nodes inside the Neo Dome establish and sync with each other sharing loads, acting as radio relays, increasing decentralisation etc   

An application on an end users device on said network, can now easily scan and connect to its nearest node   
The routing can continuously find and connect to the nearest node, wherever the end-user is on the network  
The network will have multiple Althea Gateways to the existing internet e.g. Web2.0 - allowing global access to the Scottish Bay web3.0 network   
The entire architecture and operating systems and proceedures exist in the public domain, for free, under a General Public Licence (GPL) - allowing this web3.0 network and Bloculus protocol to exist anywhere in other regions around the globe
