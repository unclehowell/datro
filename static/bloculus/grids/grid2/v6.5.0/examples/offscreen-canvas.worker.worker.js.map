You can use the full build supplied by\n * Proj4js, or create a custom build to support those projections you need; see\n * the Proj4js website for how to do this. You also need the Proj4js definitions\n * for the required projections.

Existing transforms are not changed by this function. See\n * examples/wms-image-custom-proj for an example of this.\n *\n * Additional projection definitions can be registered with `proj4.defs()` any\n * time. Just make sure to call `register(proj4)` again; for example, with user-supplied data where you don't\n * know in advance what projections are needed, you can initially load minimal\n * support and then load whichever are requested.\n *\n * Note that Proj4js does not support projection extents. If you want to add\n * one for creating default tile grids, you can add it after the Projection\n * object has been created with `setExtent`, for example,\n * `get('EPSG:1234').setExtent(extent)`.\n *\n * In addition to Proj4js support, any transform functions can be added with\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addCoordinateTransforms}. To use this, you must first create\n * a {@link module:ol/proj/Projection} object for the new projection and add it with\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addProjection}.

The pre-defined properties are listed in this documentation as\n * 'Observable Properties', and have their own accessors; for example,\n * {@link module:ol/Map~Map} has a `target` property, accessed with\n * `getTarget()` and changed with `setTarget()`. Not all properties are however\n * settable. There are also general-purpose accessors `get()` and `set()`. For\n * example, `get('target')` is equivalent to `getTarget()`.\n *\n * The `set` accessors trigger a change event, and you can monitor this by\n * registering a listener. For example, {@link module:ol/View~View} has a\n * `center` property, so `view.on('change:center', function(evt) {...});` would\n * call the function whenever the value of the center property changes. Within\n * the function, `evt.target` would be the view, so `evt.target.getCenter()`\n * would return the new center.\n *\n * You can add your own observable properties with\n * `object.set('prop', 'value')`, and retrieve that with `object.get('prop')`.\n * You can listen for changes on that property value with\n * `object.on('change:prop', listener)`. You can get a list of all\n * properties with {@link module:ol/Object~BaseObject#getProperties}.\n *\n * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.\n * You can, for example, give your map object a title with\n * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`. The\n * first will be a `hasOwnProperty`; the second will appear in\n * `getProperties()`. Only the second is observable.\n *\n * Properties can be deleted by using the unset method.

The layer will not be\n * rendered outside of this extent.\n * @property {number} [zIndex] The z-index for layer rendering.  At rendering time, the layers\n * will be ordered, first by Z-index and then by position. When `undefined`, a `zIndex` of 0 is assumed\n * for layers that are added to the map's `layers` collection, or `Infinity` when the layer's `setMap()`\n * method was used.\n * @property {number} [minResolution] The minimum resolution (inclusive) at which this layer will be\n * visible.\n * @property {number} [maxResolution] The maximum resolution (exclusive) below which this layer will\n * be visible.\n * @property {number} [minZoom] The minimum view zoom level (exclusive) above which this layer will be\n * visible.\n * @property {number} [maxZoom] The maximum view zoom level (inclusive) at which this layer will\n * be visible.\n * @property {import(\"../render.js\").OrderFunction} [renderOrder] Render order. Function to be used when sorting\n * features before rendering. By default features are drawn in the order that they are created. Use\n * `null` to avoid the sort, but get an undefined draw order.\n * @property {number} [renderBuffer=100] The buffer in pixels around the viewport extent used by the\n * renderer when getting features from the vector source for the rendering or hit-detection.\n * Recommended value: the size of the largest symbol, line width or label.\n * @property {import(\"../source/Vector.js\").default} [source] Source.\n * @property {import(\"../PluggableMap.js\").default} [map] Sets the layer as overlay on a map. The map will not manage\n * this layer in its layers collection, and the layer will be rendered on top. This is useful for\n * temporary layers. The standard way to add a layer to a map and have it managed by the map is to\n * use {@link module:ol/Map#addLayer}.\n * @property {boolean} [declutter=false] Declutter images and text. Decluttering is applied to all\n * image and text styles of all Vector and VectorTile layers that have set this to `true`. The priority\n * is defined by the z-index of the layer, the `zIndex` of the style and the render order of features.\n * Higher z-index means higher priority. Within the same z-index, a feature rendered before another has\n * higher priority.\n * @property {import(\"../style/Style.js\").StyleLike|null} [style] Layer style. When set to `null`, only\n * features that have their own style will be rendered. See {@link module:ol/style} for default style\n * which will be used if this is not set.\n * @property {boolean} [updateWhileAnimating=false] When set to `true`, feature batches will\n * be recreated during animations. This means that no vectors will be shown clipped, but the\n * setting will have a performance impact for large amounts of vector data. When set to `false`,\n * batches will be recreated when no animation is active.\n * @property {boolean} [updateWhileInteracting=false] When set to `true`, feature batches will\n * be recreated during interactions.
