Vision
==================


We believe a connected and powered world is a better one. When you empower anyone with internet and electricity, their ability to contribute and generate value for their society, grows exponentially.  

Wave® is pleased to announce that we have developed a technology which profits from reducing the internet bills of our users. During early trials of Wave® some bills even reduced to zero e.gf free internet 

The Wave® solution is an Operating System we call WaveOS™, which was awarded Patents from Google in 2016. During 2018 Wave® began developing a range of smart home products which are powered by the Wave® Operating System (WaveOS™). For more info visit our :Store:`Store2`.

WaveOS™ is free and open-source (GitHub). The latest compiled version of the software is also free to download from our website for anyone already in possession of a Single Board Computer e.g. Raspberry Pi - `https://datro.xyz/download.html <https://datro.xyz/download.html>`__.
