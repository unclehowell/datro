<p><cite>7.</cite> If any question as to the right to participate in the meeting (or part of the meeting) should arise in respect of the Secretary General, the question is to be decided by a decision of the5directors at that meeting, for which purpose the Secretary General is not to be counted as participating in the meeting (or that part of the meeting) for voting or quorum purposes.</p>
