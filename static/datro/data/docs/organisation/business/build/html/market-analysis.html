<h2>Market Research<a class="headerlink" href="#market-research" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once upon a time, there were no computers, smart phones, or many of the other cool gadgets we now take for granted. Was there a need for computers a century ago? Did people feel they lacked something? Probably not. Newspapers brought most of the news. Writing was done by hand or on typewriters. When computers became commonplace, the technology was revolutionary, making the traditional instruments redundant. And now? Typewriters are a relic of the past. Most households consider having computers, smart phones, or other such devices as basic necessities.</p>
<p>The Internet has also become a necessity as a tool for reaching out on so many different levels; global communication, shopping, social networking, gaming, business, opinion, news, sport, music, video….the list is huge and so are the possibilities. It breaks down endless boundaries and gives us a freedom never before imagined - all from the comfort of your home, business or indeed, anywhere there is a decent Wi-Fi connection or hotspot.</p>
<p>According to Internet World Statistics the total online population in the UK was 52,731,209 users in June 2012 - this was equal to 84.1% of the population. Furthermore, they cite the total Facebook user base in the UK as 32,950,400 people. This is our initial target market base as our users will log in using their social profile until Wave launches their own in Q3 2015*. This can also increase as customers may wish to create a Facebook account to gain access to the service we are offering i.e. free internet. These users we call our available online market.</p>
<p>There are 250,934,000 Facebook users in Europe and 725,009,960 users in the rest of the world. This gives an idea of the size of the available market that can be accessed once the service has been rolled out to Europe and the rest of the world. There is also room to grow our customer base as the internet penetration percentages in Europe and the Rest of the World show the available user base as more customers connect online. These users we call our emerging online market.</p>
<p><strong>UK Market</strong></p>
<p>The on-going financial crisis created by the banking system and poor government management has left most individuals and families paying the price in the UK. Our bills and cost of living are constantly on the increase, and taxes eat into every penny we earn and spend.</p>
<p>UK consumers spend approximately £1083 on line every year and the average yearly household broadband bill costs approximately £300 per year on data and line rental. That’s nearly a third of the total spend. In a UK population of over 63 million people, almost 53 million are online if, for example, a quarter of those people take up our free internet service we would have an available market of 13.25 million people with an extra £300 per year to spend where they choose.</p>
<p>We are not only enabling our customers to actually get on-line with no issue of cost, we are also enabling them to spend the additional disposable income available wherever needed. The likelihood is that some of those savings will be spent on-line on products and services. Regardless, it is certainly a substantial amount of money to spread throughout our economy and not just into the bulging pockets of the main ISP’s.</p>
<p>This equates to a win-win situation for everyone…our customers save money….they are free to spend these savings on both essentials and non-essentials on-line. They receive relevant advertising that meets their need - instead of, for example, generic; pushy campaigns run by no win no fee legal sharks. Advertisers receive valuable inventory which ultimately, sells products and services.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the economy receives a much needed boost as consumers have more spending power due to gaining an extra £20-£30 per month, for our business users, the monthly savings are even higher. Money movement such as this and the spreading of wealth more fairly is the ultimate business opportunity. Everyone gains and maybe even the economic outlook will look somewhat brighter too.</p>
<p>The business model is not entirely based on the free internet and advertising platform. This is just the start of a much bigger plan to make communications a safer and more socially beneficial experience to everyone. The internet has created a family who, if given the tools, can change things for the good and have a positive impact. Once the initial platform is tested and released we will add layers of innovative products and services that will be discussed in depth further into the business plan.</p>
<p>There are two themes which are central to the transformative effect of the internet on consumer behaviour and industry structures. The first is internet advertising revenue and the second is smartphone demand. As you can see from the key statistics the mobile advertising revenue is likely to grow quickly as the smartphone demand grows. Interestingly, users state they still use both mobile, tablet and laptop/PC devices equal to previous use depending on their location.</p>
<p>This is good news for advertising as not only is it growing on through other mediums - it is also holding its market share on older technologies. As the online audience has grown and more households have adopted faster internet connections – allowing them to consume more content quicker- so businesses have increased spend on advertising to this audience.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Advertising</strong></p>
<p>“More revenue is generated by internet advertising that by any other sector”. In 2011, Internet advertising established itself as the largest ad category by spend and accounts for 30% of advertising revenue in the UK - totalling approx. £4.8bn. Internet advertising is a key source of revenue for many of the online services consumers use.</p>
<p>Search advertising (£2.8bn) was the largest source of internet ad spend in 2011, followed by display (£1.1bn) and classified (0.8bn). Growth was fastest in search and display, up by 13% and 18% respectively on 2010 spend, while classified internet advertising has grown less quickly, up just 5%.</p>
<p>Search advertising revenues are generated by adverts placed against specific keywords that internet users search for on search engines such as Google, Yahoo! And Bing. Search advertising is unique and allows advertisers to target specific users with specific interests. By contrast, internet display advertising is very similar to display advertising in press and elsewhere, except adverts are placed as banners on web pages rather than newspaper pages.</p>
<p>Wave targeted advertising is a hybrid of search advertising and display advertising. It uses the target advertising of search, through Facebook login customer/user profile and the banner advert style of display advertising, through the rotating banner at the bottom of the screen. This banner can be used to show both static and video imaging.</p>
<p>This widens our market reach, potential and available spend by meshing together the drivers of growth in internet advertising, which is in itself the largest area of advertising spend in the UK. The success of the click thru rate backs up the effectiveness of this type of advertising shown in case studies within this document (see page ?).</p>
<p>The strong growth of display and search can be accounted for in part by the emergence of 2 rapidly growing internet advertising markets: - Online video display advertising (revenue and time spend on film /video sited: 2008- 2011)</p>
<p>Video display advertising spend was £109m in 2011, approximately 10% of all internet display advertising revenue. Video display ads have seen exceptional growth since 2008, increasing their revenue eight-fold.</p>
<p>Online video advertising can take one of two forms. The first is similar to display advertising on websites, but in the form of an audio-visual advert rather than a static image or a series of animated images. The second is similar to traditional spot television advertising, where adverts are shown either before, after or mid-way through an online video.</p>
<p>According to research published by comScore, just under 22 million internet users aged 6+ watched at least one online video advert in January 2012. Men were more likely than women to view online video adverts and the main age range for this was 15-24 year olds. Demographic profile of video advertisement viewers</p>
<p>In 2011, expenditure on mobile advertising rose to £203m, more than double that of 2010, and representing like-for-like growth of 157%. Since 2008, mobile advertising revenues have grown 7-fold and in the same time the proportion of adults using their mobile phone to access the internet has doubled (20% to 39%).</p>
<p>The UK Communications Market Report 2011 highlighted the rise of the mobile internet and the likelihood that smartphone take-up was the primary driver of the increasing data services available on mobile phones.</p>
<p>It is also likely that smartphone take-up is the driver behind the growth of mobile advertising. Smartphones appear to facilitate the use of the mobile internet, increasing the mobile internet audience and making the platform a more attractive proposition for advertisers. Furthermore, the technological capabilities of today’s smartphones, such as touchscreens, large high definition displays, high-speed processors, and operating systems capable of installing apps, present a wider range of creative opportunities for advertisers.</p>
<p>Mobile advertising revenues and smartphone and mobile internet take-up.</p>
<p>In 2011 search is two-thirds (66%) of mobile advertising revenue was generated by mobile search advertising, unchanged since 2010, and the remainder by mobile display (34%). The advances in mobile handset technology represented by smartphones, and the move away from WAP, have increased the similarity of the mobile internet to the conventional PC internet. As such, mobile search adverts and mobile display adverts are very much the same as their counterparts described above</p>
<p><strong>Smartphone Demand</strong></p>
<p>“2 in every 5 UK adults now have a smartphone” Smartphones are a key enabler in the rise of the mobile internet and which has changed the way consumers live their everyday lives. Between 2011 and 2012 smartphone take up rose from 27% to 39% of UK adults, representing 43% of mobile users. Smartphone take up is highest among younger age groups: 66% of those aged 16 to 24 and 60% of those aged 25 to 34 have a smartphone, as do 46% of the ABC1</p>
<p>More than 4 in 10 smartphone users (42%) agree with the statement: “my phone is more important to me for accessing the internet than any other device”. Agreement is highest in the 16-24 &amp; 25-44 age groups. Smartphone users are highly dependent on their phones. Just over 4 in 10 (41%) smartphone users indicated high levels of addiction compared to 37% in 2011.</p>
<p>Smartphones are used for traditional internet activities and new internet phenomena. The top 5 activities or functions used regularly on a smartphone by UK adults are e mail (51%), internet surfing (44%), social networking (42%), taking photos/video (37%), and listening to music (35%). These are the same activities as recorded in the top five in the 2011 survey. Many of the activities have seen marginal increases since 2011, with e mail measuring the biggest increase, up 5% from 46% in 2011.</p>
<p>New activities or functions new to the 2012 survey are tweeting, checking into a place or location on social networks and using voice activated services. Smartphones are substituting for other devices and media formats. The activities that smartphone users claim their handset is substituting for most are: watching video clips on a PC or laptop, instant messaging from a PC or laptop and social networking from a PC or laptop. But significant numbers of people say that they are still doing the same amount of activities on other new devices since getting their smartphones.</p>
<p>“1 in 5 (20%) of smartphone users also own a tablet PC” Tablet computers and smartphones have many features in common and despite the overlap in functionality, 1 in 5 smartphone users also own a PC. A significant proportion of consumers, for each activity, claimed to use their smartphone and tablet equally so it is likely that the device used is determined by the location of the consumer. Tablets are primarily used at home as a more portable; internet surfing &amp; user friendly version of bulkier and heavier laptop or PC. This is the evolution of our technology types based on needs of use. We are now seeing the introduction of the removable key pad (Asus Transformer Prime) that will thus give us 2 devices in 1. Tablet for play and keyboard option for work.</p>
<p>Smartphones are alternatively, used as a mobile device and as a private communication device; whereas two-thirds of consumers share their tablets in their household. Therefore, a tablet is less likely to be seen as a personal communications device. Principal device for selected activities among smartphone and tablet More than half (57%) of smartphone users claim to have used their handset in some way when out shopping.</p>
<p>Key findings
- 8 in 10 households have access to the internet Household internet access rose to 80% in Q1 2012, up 3% points on the previous year.
- Over half of all UK households have 3 or more internet-enabled devices. 85% of households own at least 1 internet enabled device and on average each household owns 3 different types of internet enabled device. Only 1 in a thousand owns all 10 devices surveyed.</p>
<p>Games consoles are more popular than laptops or PC’s among DE households. 46% own a games console, compared to just 44% who own a laptop and 30% own a PC. In contrast, among AB households, 75% own a laptop and 56% own a PC, while 51% own games consoles.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Growth of accessing the internet on laptop and desktop computers is slowing.</li>
<li>Young adult men spend the most time online via a laptop or desktop computer (34.1 hours p/month) than any other age/gender group, and almost 10 hours more per month than the UK average of 24.2 hours for March 2012</li>
<li>Two thirds of 65-74 years olds now have home internet access, the largest rise among all age groups. This rose by 9% to 64% between 2012 to 2012. Internet access was highest among those aged 16 to 34 (90%) and AB social groups (92%).</li>
<li>1 in 7 UK adults do not intend to get the internet in the next year. Overall, 2 thirds cite lack of interest as the main reason for not getting the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wi-Fi networks are a key enabler for homes with multiple internet enabled devices !</p>
<p>In Q1 2012 the proportion of homes with broadband using a wireless router rose 10% to 85%. As highlighted in the graph above, a number of devices which were not widely available 5 years ago (e.g. netbooks, smartphones and tablets) can be connected to the internet over Wi-Fi</p>
<p>Internet-enabled devices</p>
<p>The networks over which the device connects and the internet experience that the device delivers both vary. The laptop is the most popular device that can connect to the internet among UK households (61%). Games consoles are the second most popular type of internet enabled device, followed by desktop PC (44%).</p>
<p>In regards to ownership of each type of internet-enabled device as a proportion of the AB, C1, C2 and DE socio-economic groups – for almost all internet-enabled devices, ownership is highest among AB households and lowest among DE households, probably related to the greater disposable income to spend on such devices in AB households. The exception to this rule is ownership of TV-based and portable games console, where take up is higher among C1 and C2 households than in AB households.</p>
<p>Counter to the UK average, games consoles are more popular than laptops or PC’s among DE households, with PC’s and smartphones are more popular than games consoles among AB households.</p>
<p>The proportion of each social group owning internet-enabled devices</p>
<p>Three quarters of e-readers (74%) and tablets (76%) are owned by ABC1 households compared to just 6 in 10 internet-enabled set top boxes (Sky + etc.). Internet devices of all kinds are more likely to be owned by ABC1 households than C2DE households, but that balance of ownership varies according to device.</p>
<p>Recent market entrants such as e-readers, tablets and netbooks, the functionality of which is replicated among existing devices, are more likely to be owned by ABC1 households than C2DE households.</p>
<p>Those aged 16-24 were the most likely to have accessed the internet on a mobile phone, games console, or portable media player. However, those aged 25-34 and 35-44 were more likely than other age groups to have accessed the internet on a tablet computer. The proportion of households by social group in the 2001 UK census was AB 22%, C1 29%, C2 15%, D 17% and E16%</p>
<p>Devices used to visit internet websites in 2011 by age. Each household in the UK has on average 3 different types of internet enabled device and 85% of households have at least 1.</p>
<p>Number of different internet-enabled devices per household</p>
<p><strong>Internet take-up</strong></p>
<p>Home internet access in the UK continues to grow, increasing by 3% to 80% for Q1 2012. Home internet access is evenly spread across those aged 16 to 54 but decreases beyond this age range. However, the proportion of adults aged 16 to 54 but decreases beyond this age range. However, the proportion of adults aged 65 to 74 with home internet access grew strongly over the year, rising 9% to 64% by 2012. The % of 16-24 year olds with access to the internet grew by 5% between 2011-2012; to 90%, and brings this age group level with those aged 25 to 34 (90%) and 35 to 54 (88%). Home internet access is highest for the AB socio-economic group (92%) and lowest for DE’s (63%), while access is 3% higher among men (81%) than women (78%).</p>
<p>Home internet access by age, socio-economic group, and gender</p>
<p>Since January 2004 the size of the UK online audience rose on average 6.2% each year; from 24.5 million to 39.7 million in January 2012 was 1.6%, compared to a high of 10.3% in January 2009. It is likely that the slowing growth of broadband take-up has contributed to the slowing growth of the online audience.</p>
<p><strong>Time Spent online</strong></p>
<p>In January 2012 the average amount of time internet users spent online through a laptop or desktop was 24.6 hours per month, more than double the amount of time users spent online in January 2004. However, the growth in time spent online appears to have plateaued. The average time online per month increased by only half an hour between 2010 and 2011; to 23.5 hours, and while increasing, this is still less than the peak average of 23.9 hours/moth in 2009. Two likely reasons for this slowed growth are the effect of late adopters and the growth of other internet-enabled devices. Late adopters of the internet characteristically spend less time online than average, so as more late adopters get connected the average time online may decrease. Furthermore, the data does not include time spent online on smartphones, tablets, or other internet-connected devices, which are likely to be substituting for time online on laptop or desktop computers.</p>
<p>33 million adults accessed the internet every day in 2012 in the UK, more than double the 2006 figure of 16 million. Approximately 87% of adults aged between 16 and 24, used social networking sites in 2012, compared to 48% of all adults. Telephone or video calls over the internet were made by 32% of adults in 2012, double the 2009 estimate of 16%, and four times higher than the 2007 estimate of 8% (Office of National Statistics Feb 2013). The higher tier of earners in the socioeconomic status groups are at the front of the queue when it comes to technology. This “early adopter” behaviour tends to lead to earlier market penetration and advanced levels of usage, according to a recent eMarketer report. In 2012, data from Ofcom indicated that affluents spent an average 21 hours per week using the internet. This was well above the next most engaged socioeconomic demographic. But not only are UK affluents big users of digital media they are also wary of it, as their engagement with social media shows a low level of engagement. Those in the upper-middle and middle class use the internet for extremely varied purposes, with communication coming out on top: 92% of affluents took part in this activity at least once a week, according to a survey by Ofcom. One activity that this group performed far more regularly than other groups was online transactions, with 61% of affluents carrying out such transactions at least once per week. Smart mobile devices are another digital technology UK affluents have taken up quickly. According to Ofcom data, in terms of smartphones, the figure for affluents was 62%, above all other segments. Tablets have also seen especially high uptake among affluents.</p>

<h2>Types of Customers<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-customers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The ideal customer profile is of someone who considers this saving relevant and meaningful, yet also has some spare income to make purchases on line and who also sees the advertising as useful and relevant. They will also be open to change and innovation and aware of social and environmental factors that are shaping the world at the moment.</p>
<p>If we break it down the ideal profile is as follows:
- Men and women
- Age 21-50
- Income: mainly lower-middle and higher-middle income individuals
- Singles, Married couples &amp; families
- Socially aware</p>
<p>Families, although may not have as much disposable income as singles &amp; married couples, are shorter on time and likely to use the internet to make purchases. The internet has a major advantage over the high street in that you can search and find the product for the lowest price available in minutes. Nobody these days wishes to spend hours walking or driving from shop to shop to find the best deal, when it can be accessed at home or at a hotspot almost instantly</p>

This team of approximately 200 advertisers, ISP’s and developers will consist of some of the biggest movers &amp; shakers within the industry. The partners will all be charged a monthly subscription fee in return for input, exclusive use of the platform before public release, partnership deals and shares in the company. These partners will also have the opportunity to tender for any of the project mandates in the next few months and following release.</p>
<p>Pre sign up, each partner agree to be bound by our terms and conditions, which will include an NDA that will protect our business and any projects that are discussed and produced within CENTIA.</p>
<p>The alliance itself will stabilise and change con-currently with the business evolution. For example, as we move the focus from the launch of our free internet service to the development of the Wave App Store, the advertising agencies and ISP’s will unsubscribe and new, more relevant businesses and developers will take their place. These alternative partners will work with us to bring the next roll out to market and the WT customer base.</p>
<p>The number of members will stay constant throughout the lifespan of the business as the main objective is to keep bringing our customers the most innovative technology possible.</p>

<p>This is currently an untapped niche market, which means competitors do not currently exist in the UK. Indeed, up until now, we have only found one other business that is operating within our sector in California but there are still major differences in our business models.</p>
