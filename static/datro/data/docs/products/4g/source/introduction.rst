Wave® Operating System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For simplicity each product in the Wave® Smart Home™ uses the exact same hardware device and operating system. 
The core hardware solution is known as a Single Board Computer (SBC). 
The  software is known as the Wave® Operating System (WaveOS™) and runs all of the devices in the Wave® Smart Home™. 

WaveOS™ is Free, Open-Source and is held on a Micro SD Card inside of every Wave® Smart Home™ product. 
WaveOS™ makes initial boot and configuration of the device very simple, by establishing an internet connection and generating a Wi-Fi Hotspot autonomously. 
The operator can then connect their device to the Wi-Fi Hotspot and complete initial set-up via their web-browser.

To complete initial set-up, the operator must simply select which Edition of WaveOS™ they'd like installed to the device. 
The Edition of WaveOS™ installed will determine which product the device will become (or which function the device will serve within the  Smart Home™). 
For example, if the operator selects the HSPA+ Smart Home Hotspot™ Edition of WaveOS™, it will transform the SBC a HSPA+ Smart Home Hotspot™. 
The initial installation is done via a web browser menu (no programming skills required). Initial installation is made one-click, fully autonomous and takes only a few minutes.
