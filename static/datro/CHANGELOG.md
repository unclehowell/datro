# Changelog
It's expected that developers log all changes to this directory, in this CHANGELOG.md file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

1. This websites within a directory of a directry of a gh-pages repo
   - for this reason `index.html` is located two directory levels up e.g. for `index.html` you'd instead use `../../index.html`  
   - equally `index.html` has to locate files in this directory e.g. for `"css/style.css"` you'd instead use `static/datro/css/style.css`  
   - this said a copy of ../../index.html exists in this directory (with updated links) so there's no 404 or redirect when you visit datro.xyz/static/datro/

## [datro.03] - Q2/2021

       - `static-datro.03` is added to the end to reflect this subdirectories version'  
       -  must find a way to use semantic version badges on the published content too to save viewing the changelogs for version numbers   

### Removed
Jun-25 - Removed `))` at the start of `static/datro/html/statistics/website.html` - typo error, shouldn't be there

### Ideas

Jun-25 - Make the `static/library` html library explorer theme match the `static/datro/documents.html` page e.g. maybe a html tag in the library explorer menu to show the release version   

## [0.0.2] - Q1/2021

### Added
Jan-31 - The Academy link was missing from the index page so I added it  

### Changed
Mar-25 - Links to Facebook Page were incorrect, changed it sitewide  
Mar-25 - Noticed the video player has stopped functioning. So updated npm and re-installed the solution adopted, but no success locally. Will push and try remotely again later  
Mar-10 - Academy.html said GPL was General Open Licence (bad case of find and replace by the looks of it) changed "Open" back to "Public" so it makes sense  
Jan-31 - Html/statistics/website.html - few minor bug fixes - made it look better on mobile.   

### Fixed
Mar-23 - Fixed some broken links  
Feb-06 - Removed broken links - since the problematic pages were dormant I just erazed them, but kept the pages so as not to cause more broken links  
Jan-31 - Html/statistics/website.html - commit comments weren't showing. simple fault, path to js was incorrect.   

### Removed
Mar-23 - Bulk removed Â® symbol, since this is now all GNU GPL   
Jan-31 - Deleted directories labelled old as part of typical housekeeping   


## [0.0.1] - Q3/2020

### Added
Sep-13 - GNU General Public Licence - sitewide  
Sep-13 - Local boostrap-grid.css, or else the columbs turn into rows if the cdn bootstrap isn't reachable.  

### Changed
Sep-13 - Redirected all the pending webpages to the main page. Until they're ready to present. (see meta in header)  
Sep-13 - Changed `href="#myCarousel"` to `data-target="#myCarousel"` on the splashpage, to fix a bug (page was scrolling)  
Sep-13 - html theme now matches website theme  

### Removed
Sep-13 - <link href="https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/bundles/jquery-4df54fac.js" rel="preload"> appeared multiple times on the same page.  
Sep-13 - Modernizer.js is discontinued, not the service, just the single js file method. So it's been removed, since it was causing errors.  
Sep-13 - Removed videolightning.js too, haven't used that feature for a while.  

### Fixed
Sep-13 - The frame the docs are displayed in (featherlight) was scrolling upwards off screen, whenever you selected the doc. Fixed it!  
Sep-13 - Copyleft symbol wasn't appearing on chrome on android. Reversed copyright symbol using css instead.   
Sep-13 - Changed background color to theme, the white default was making the website look poor between page refreshes  

### To Do
Sep-13 - The dropdown in the footers seems to work locally now, let's see if it works when the sites pushed to gh-pages .... No :(
