# Changelog
It's expected that developers log all changes to this directory, in this CHANGELOG.md file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [hbnb.02] - Q4/2021

### Fixed 
Oct-02 - `manifest.json` was missing `:` after `"icons"`. Final comma also removed to clear errors    

### Changed
Dec-03 - Troubleshooting last commit. Minor edit to lookup.html   
Dec-03 - Last commit didn't work. Few minor edits, trying again  
Dec-03 - Changed URL of Demo, now it runs a lookup. If the address bar is `hbnb.datro.xyz` then `datro.xyz/static/gui/` is displayed. Otherwise `../gui` is displayed & sufficient  
Dec-01 - Added `lookup.html` and `js/jquery-3.3.1.min.js` - url detection, to determin url of demo based on url in address bar  
Nov-30 - Cleared _config.yml and inserted `exclude: - Gemfile` instead (trying to get this site published via netlify)   

### Removed
Dec-01 - Removed _config.yml, not needed  


## [-hbnb.01] - Q3/2021

### Added
Aug-13 - Minor edit to README.md - almost lost a handy bit of code, so I put it in the README for now. Really it should be in docs, will get to that later  

## [-hbnb.01] - Q2/2021

### Added 
17-Apr - Added double spaces to end of paragraphs in this changelog so it presents on github.com website the same as in a text editor   

### Changed
23-May - Changed the images from `.png` to `.webp`  


## [0.0.3] - Q1/2021

### Changed
14-Feb - Minor edit. Typo/ spelling correction  

## [0.0.2] - Q4/2020

### Added
13-Dec - Changed all instances of 'HotspotBnB' to 'Hotspotβnβ'  

### Changed
14-Dec - FavIcons updated to show the new Hotspotβnβ Logo  
10-Oct - Changed the github.com release url, from the hbnb repo, to the datro repo  
       - - inacurate according to our semantic release methodology and nomenclature, but it's only temporary.  
       - - at least until the hbnb net installer source code branch is moved from hbnb to datro   

## [0.0.1] - Q3/2020

### Added
00-Ooo - put some css into the header to allow scrolling, but hide the scrollbars  
00-Ooo - it should be in the css, but one step at a time. Will try that next, but not on the main (on the beta)  

### Changed
13-Sep - got rid of a horizontal scrollbar which was very apparent against the contrasting footer color.   

### Fixed
