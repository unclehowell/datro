## Slides

### Introduction

Sphinx has been used to produce the documents, but it's also able to do slideshows. 
This could be ideal for things like annual keynotes, since our policy is to be as self reliant as possble, 
with all of the resources we need within our monorepo. Using Google Slides kind of defeats this.
