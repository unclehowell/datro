# DATRO Consortium: MonoREAPo

The MonoREAPo is a unification of a GitHub Mono Repository and a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

In a "Monorepo" (GitHub Mono Repository) all source code is organised into a single directory. Even software dependancies can exist as sub-repos within the monorepo. 
In a DAO, stakeholders e.g. creditors/investors (and in this case developers) are able to reap remuneration fully autonomously and without central points of control (a server, a bank etc) nor conventional identification methods e.g. passports, driving licences etc.
This is achived through a hierarchy of cryptocurrency smart contracts, able to remunerate stakeholders.

  - Everything above is hosted for free on github (gh-pages)
  - This branch, alongside other branches, belong to the same repository, hence the term "monorepo"
  - Since DATRO combines this with our very own remuneration solution, we use the term "monoREAPo"

### Branches

Below are DATRO's other monoREAPo branches:

| Branch                    | Details                                                                             |
|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|[net-installer](https://github.com/unclehowell/datro/tree/net-installer "DATRO Net-Installer Branch") | Scripts to autonomously build disk images, which equally self-build (and config) when inserted into target devices |  
|[netlify](https://github.com/unclehowell/datro/tree/netlify "DATRO Netlify Branch") | For showcasing purposes this 'netlify' adaptation of the Hotspotβnβ GUI replaces webapps with DATRO's core assets (websites etc) |  
|[subrepos](https://github.com/unclehowell/datro/tree/subrepos "DATRO SubRepos Branch") | Catalogues all software dependancies as subrepos, simulating a staging server of sorts, between end-users and developers |
