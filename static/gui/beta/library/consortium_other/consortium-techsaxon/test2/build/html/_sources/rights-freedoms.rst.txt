Rights and Freedoms
=====================

There are now over a billion regulatory and statutory laws that deem what is legal. But a lawful rebellion identified that introduced and still operates unconstitutionally and fraudulently. Using the Magna Carta Charter, we're now movement has jurisdiction was witnessing legal and lawful opt-in, opt-out juristiction.

WAVE will cause wide spread effects and regardiess of legislation, deployment is imminent. The technology has already been legislated against as it poses threat, but to whom Society itself, or simply the archaic social systems still in operation today?

There is however, still a need for jurisdiction in this new social structure to ensure it is hot abused. WAVE grants free digital communication services to citizens subject to them accessing the network by use of their social profile identities. Here in lies all of the ingredients needed to enforce jurisdiction.

Governments can evolve into 'Gatekeeper' by re-introducing their retractable benefits and privilege system. But this time with the access points of digital communication itself But this time it can more accurately measure and manage an individuals contribution (to society) and consumption and behaviour.

WAVE also allows real-time democracy of the resource by giving the interactive adverts network control. User's phone / internet access could become limited or content restricted until they contribute value to society's common goals. This is potentially an improved jurisdiction that could be welcomed.

WAVE also encourages Dr Eric Schmidt's future vision of dual crowdsourcing. In a fully comnected world, incidents can be reported collectively and anonymously using mobile devices. In response, jurors can pass back judgments, collectively and anonymously.
