<h2>Disclosure<a class="headerlink" href="#disclosure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each party hereunder may disclose to the other party certain Trade Secrets and Confidential Information of such party or of such party’s associated companies, suppliers, or customers. For purposes of this Agreement, “Trade Secrets” means information which: (a) derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (b) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy; “Confidential Information” means information, other than Trade Secrets, that is of value to its owner and is treated as confidential; “Proprietary Information” means Trade Secrets and Confidential Information; “Owner” refers to the party disclosing Proprietary Information hereunder, whether such party is Company or Distributor and whether such disclosure is directly from Owner or through Owner’s employees or agents; and “Recipient” refers to the party receiving any Proprietary Information hereunder, whether such party is Company or Distributor and whether such disclosure received directly or through Recipient’s employees or agents.</p>

<h2>Requirement of Confidentiality<a class="headerlink" href="#requirement-of-confidentiality" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Recipient agrees to hold the Proprietary Information disclosed by Owner in confidence and not to, directly or indirectly, copy, reproduce, distribute, manufacture, duplicate, reveal, report, publish, disclose, cause to be disclosed, or otherwise transfer the Proprietary Information disclosed by Owner to any third party, or utilize the Proprietary Information disclosed by Owner for any purpose whatsoever other than as expressly contemplated by this Agreement. Recipient shall protect the disclosed Proprietary Information by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of the Proprietary Information as Recipient uses to protect its own proprietary or confidential information of a like nature.  With regard to the Trade Secrets, this obligation shall continue for so long as such information constitutes a trade secret under applicable law. With regard to the Confidential Information, this obligation shall continue for the Term and for a period of five (5) years thereafter. The foregoing obligations shall not apply if and to the extent that:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Recipient establishes that the information communicated was already known to Recipient, without obligations to keep such information confidential, at the time of Recipient’s receipt from Owner, as evidenced by documents in the possession of Recipient prepared or received prior to disclosure of such information;</li>
<li>Recipient establishes that the information communicated was received by Recipient in good faith from a third party lawfully in possession thereof and having no obligation to keep such information confidential; or</li>
<li>Recipient establishes that the information communicated was publicly known at the time of Recipient’s receipt from Owner or has become publicly known other than by a breach of this Agreement.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="security-measures">
<h2>Security Measures<a class="headerlink" href="#security-measures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Without limiting the general obligations specified above in
Section 11.2, Recipient agrees to implement the following security steps in order to protect the confidentiality and security of the Proprietary Information disclosed by Owner:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Implement internal procedures to limit, control and supervise the use of the Proprietary Information disclosed by Owner;</li>
<li>Make the Proprietary Information disclosed by Owner available only to employees of Recipient who have executed written confidentiality agreements with Recipient;</li>
<li>Notify Company by Email, Phone or writing of any suspected or known breach of the obligations and/or restrictions set forth in this Section 11; and</li>
<li>Use similar security procedures it uses for its own Proprietary Information, which it protects against unauthorized disclosure, appropriation or use, but not less than reasonable security procedures.</li>
