This package for mkusb version 8.5.3 is the first to contain a desktop file and an icon fil.

The script mkusb uses a text based 'window' by dialog as well as graphical user interface windows by zenity.

Version 8.5.4 contains a man page and some improvements and bugfixes, to make it a useful desktop application.

At version 9.0 mkusb is split into two separate programs:

- mkusb which runs only in graphical desktop environments and using zenity for all menus plus a console window powered by xterm for output from the engine behind the curtain.

- There is new separate help menu including linking to the wiki page

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb

- mkusb-nox which has a simple text interface (that of version 7.4) plus improved recognition of systems and devices (backported from version 8). This program needs no extra program packages. So mkusb-nox is given the version number 7.5, and it is distributed together with mkusb via the PPA.

- mkusb 9.0.4 is tested in several linux distros and can switch to 'legacy mode' if zenity is not compiled with WebKit and cannot use the --html option.

- mkusb 9.2.3 has an improved look and feel.

- mkusb 10.0.2 lets you create either a live only or persistent live target drive.
